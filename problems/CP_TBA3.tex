\begin{problem}
A familiar proof that $\sqrt[3]{7^2}$ is irrational depends on the
fact that a certain equation among those below is unsatisfiable by
integers $a, b > 0$.  Circle the equation, and explain why it is
unsatisfiable.
\begin{enumerate}[i.]
\item $a^2 = 7^2+ b^2$
\item $a^3 = 7^2 + b^3$
\item $a^2 = 7^2b^2$
%\item $a^3 = 7b^3$
\item $a^3 = 7^2b^3$
\item $a^3 = 7^3b^3$
\item $(ab)^3 = 7^2$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{staffnotes}
2pts (that is, -18pt) for picking an irrelevant equation, say $(ab)^3 =
7^2$, and showing it is unsat.

You could prove that $a^3 = 7^2b^3$ is unsat by assuming that
$\sqrt[3]{7^2}$ is irrational as proved in class.  Not what I wanted,
but We are obligated to give full credit for this.
\end{staffnotes}

\begin{solution}
\[
a^3 = 7^2b^3.
\]

By the unique factorization theorem, the prime factorization of $a^3$
is obtained by repeating the prime factors of $a$ three times.  So
every prime in the factorization of $a^3$ must appear three times.
Likewise for $b^3$.

But the number of appearances of 7 in the factorization of the right
hand side, $7^2b^3$, leaves a remainder of two when divided by three,
and so will not equal the number of appearances of 7 in factorization
of the left hand side, $a^3$.
\end{solution}
