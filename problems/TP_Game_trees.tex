\begin{problem}
In the game tree for the game Tic-Tac-Toe, the root has nine children
corresponding to the nine boxes that the first player could mark with
an ``X''.

Each of these nine nodes will have eight children in the second level
of the tree, indicating where the second player can mark his ``O'',
giving a total of 72 nodes.

Answer the following questions about the game tree for Tic-Tac-Toe.
\bparts

\ppart
How many nodes will be in the third level of the tree? 
\begin{solution}
\textbf{504.}

Each of the $9*8=72$ nodes in the second level will have 7 children,
giving a total of $9*8*7=504$.
\end{solution}

\ppart What is the first level where this simple pattern of calculating nodes
stops working?

\begin{solution}
\textbf{Level 6.}

At the fifth level, it's possible that player 1 has won, and so the
number of nodes on the sixth level will not simply be 4 times the
number of nodes on the fifth.
\end{solution}
