\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Game trees

In the game tree for the game Tic-Tac-Toe,
the root has nine children corresponding to the nine boxes that the first
player could mark with an  ``X''.

Each of these nine nodes will have eight children each in the second level
of the tree, indicating where the second player can mark with an  ``O'',
giving a total of 72 nodes.


Answer the following questions about the game tree for Tic-Tac-Toe.
\bparts


\ppart
How many nodes will be in the third level of the tree? 



\begin{solution}

504


Each of the 72 nodes in the second level will have 7
               children giving a total of 504
\end{solution}

\ppart
What is the first level where this simple pattern of calculating
           nodes stops working? 

\begin{solution}

6


At the fifth level, it's possible that
                  player 1 has won and so the number of nodes on
                  the 6th level will not simply be 4 times the number
\end{solution}
