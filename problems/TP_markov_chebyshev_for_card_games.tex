\begin{problem}
  A gambler plays 120 hands of draw poker, 60 hands of black jack, and 20
  hands of stud poker per day.  He wins a hand of draw poker with
  probability 1/6, a hand of black jack with probability 1/2, and a hand
  of stud poker with probability 1/5.  %He hopes to win 108 hands per day.

\bparts

\ppart What is the expected number of hands the gambler wins in a day?

\begin{solution}
$120(1/6)+60(1/2)+20(1/5)=54$.
\end{solution}

\ppart What would the Markov bound be on the probability that the
gambler will win at least 108 hands on a given day?

\begin{solution}
The expected number of games won is 54, so
by Markov, $\pr{R \geq 108} \leq 54/108 = 1/2$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Assume the outcomes of the card games are pairwise independent.
What is the variance in the number of hands won per day?

\begin{solution}
The variance can also be calculated using linearity of variance.
For an individual hand the variance is $p(1-p)$ where $p$ is the
probability of winning.  Therefore the variance is
\[
120(1/6)(5/6) + 60(1/2)(1/2) + 20(1/5)(4/5) = 523/15 = 34\ \tfrac{13}{15}.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart What would the Chebyshev bound be on the probability that the
gambler will win at least 108 hands on a given day?  You may answer with a
numerical expression that is not completely evaluated.

\begin{solution}
\[
\pr{R - 54 \geq 54} \leq \pr{\abs{R - 54} \geq 54} \leq
\frac{Var[R]}{54^2} = \frac{523}{15(54)^2} \approx 0.01196.
\]

\iffalse
A very slightly better bound comes from using the one-sided Chebyshev
bound from Problem Set 11:
\[
\pr{R - 54 \geq 54} \leq \frac{V}{V + 54^2}
= \frac{523}{523 + 15(54)^2} \approx 0.0182.
\]
