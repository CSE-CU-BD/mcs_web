\begin{problem}

Suppose $2k+1$ numbers are selected from $\set{1,2,3, \dots,4k}$.
Using the Pigeonhole Principle, show that
there must be two selected numbers whose difference is $k$.
Clearly indicate what are the pigeons, holes, and rules for assigning a pigeon to a hole.

\begin{solution}
  The $2k+1$ selected numbers are the pigeons.
  The pigeonholes will be the sets $\set{1,k+1}$, $\set{2,k+2}$, \ldots, $\set{k, 2k}$,
  $\set{2k+1,3k+1}$, $\set{2k+2,3k+2}$, \ldots, $\set{3k,4k}$.
  There are $2k$ holes, so two pigeons must be assigned to some hole and their
  difference will be $k$.
\end{solution}
