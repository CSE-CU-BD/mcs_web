\begin{problem}

Suppose $2n+1$ numbers are selected from $\set{1,2,3, \dots,4n}$.
Using the Pigeonhole Principle, show that for any positive integer $j$
that divides $2n$, there must be two selected numbers whose difference
is $j$.  Clearly indicate what are the pigeons, holes, and rules for
assigning a pigeon to a hole.

\begin{solution}
  Partition $\set{1,2,3, \dots,2n}$ into 2-element sets of the form $\set{k,k+j}$.
  You should convince yourself that there is only way one to do this, namely,
\begin{align*}
\set{1, 1+j},\set{2, 2+j}, \dots, \set{j, j+j},\\
\set{2j+1,(2j+1)+j},\set{2j+2,(2j+2) + j},\dotsm \set{2j+j,(2j+j) + j}\\
\set{4j+1,(4j+1)+j},\set{4j+2,(4j+2) + j},\dotsm \set{4j+j,(4j+j) + j}\\
\set{5j+1,(5j+1)+j},\set{5j+2,(5j+2) + j},\dotsm \set{5j+j,(5j+j) + j}\\
\set{7j+1,(7j+1)+j},\set{7j+2,(7j+2) + j},\dotsm \set{7j+j,(7j+j) + j}\\
\qquad \vdots\\
\set{(4n-2j+1), (4n-2j +1)+j},\set{(4n-2j)+2,((4n-2j)+2) + j},\dots \set{(4n-2j+j),4n}.
\end{align*}

  The $2n+1$ selected numbers are the pigeons.  The pigeonholes will
  be the $2n$ sets of the form $\set{k,k+j}$ in the partition.  Assign
  a pigeon to the block of the partition that contains it.  Since
  there are more pigeons than holes, two pigeons must be assigned to
  some hole, which means their difference is $k$.
\end{solution}
