\begin{problem}
% Tests understanding of infinite sets

Prove that the set $S$ of all ordered triples of positive integers is countable:
\begin{center}
$S = \{(a, b, c)\ |\ a,b,c \in \mathbb Z_+\}$.
\end{center}

\hint You might find inspiration from a class problem where you showed that the set of pairs is countable.
