\ppart How many simple undirected graphs are there with 
$V=\set{1,2,\ldots,n}$?

\begin{solution}
There are $\binom{n}{2}$ potential edges, each of which may or
may not appear in a given graph.  Therefore, the number of graphs is:
\[
2^{\binom{n}{2}}
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart How many digraphs are there with $V=\set{1,2,\ldots,n}$?

\begin{solution}

There are $n^2$ potential edges, each of which may or
may not appear in a given graph.  Therefore, the number of graphs is:
\[
2^{n^2}
\]

\end{solution}

\ppart Consider a $n$-player round-robin tournament where every pair of
  distinct players compete in a single game that doesn't allow for a tie.
  We can model the results of such a tournament using either a ``beats''
  relation or a digraph (called a \emph{tournament graph}).  The players
  are represented by vertices and there is an edge $x \beats y$ if $x$
  beat $y$.  How many tournament graphs are there with $V=\set{1,2,\ldots,n}$?

\begin{solution}
There are no self-loops in a tournament graph and 
for each of the $\binom{n}{2}$ pairs of distinct vertices $a$ and $b$,
either $a \beats b$ or $b \beats a$ but not both. Therefore, the 
number of tournament graphs is:
\[
2^{\binom{n}{2}}
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart How many acyclic tournament graphs are there with 
$V=\set{1,2,\ldots,n}$?

\hint We showed in the class problems that an acyclic tournament 
graph defines a total order.

\begin{solution}
For any path from $x$ to $y$ in a tournament graph, an edge
$y \beats x$ would create a cycle.  Therefore in any acyclic tournament
graph, the existence of a path between distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ 
would require the edge $x \beats y$ also be in the graph.  That is, the
"beats" relation for such a graph would be transitive.  Since each 
pair of distinct players are comparable (either $x \beats y$ or 
$y \beats x$) we can uniquely rank the players $x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_n$.
There are $n!$ such rankings.
