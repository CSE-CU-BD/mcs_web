We may assume by structural induction that $P(a)$ and$P(b)$ both hold.  We must prove $P(s)$.If $t \in \RM$, then $bt \in \RM$ by the induction hypothesis $P(b)$.Now,\[s \cdot t = (\lefbrk a \rhtbrk b) t = \lefbrk a \rhtbrk (b t),\]and the right hand term describes a string in $\RM$ by theconstructor.  This proves $P(s)$.By structural induction, we conclude that $P(s)$ is true for all $s\in \RM$, that is,\[\forall s, t \in \RM.\, s \cdot t \in \RM \]as claimed.\end{solution}\ppart\label{AMsubRM} Prove $\AM \subseteq \RM$, where \AM\ is the setof ambiguous matched strings\inbook{ of  Definition~\bref{AM_def}}.\inhandout{\footnote{ The set, $\AM    \subseteq \brkts$ is defined recursively as follows:\begin{itemize}\item \textbf{Base case:} $\emptystring \in \AM$,\item \textbf{Constructor cases:} if $s,t \in \AM$, then  the strings $\lefbrk s\, \rhtbrk$ and $st$ are also in $\AM$.\end{itemize}}}\begin{solution}We need to show that $\forall s \in \AM.\, s \in \RM$.  The proof isby structural induction on the definition of $s \in \AM$.\textbf{Induction hypothesis:} $P(s) \eqdef s \in \RM$.\textbf{Base case:} ($s = \emptystring$).  $P(s)$ holds by the basecase for $\RM$.\textbf{Constructor case:}($s = \lefbrk a \rhtbrk$ for $a \in \AM$).We may assume by structural induction that $P(a)$ holds.   Now\[s = \lefbrk a \rhtbrk = \lefbrk a \rhtbrk \emptystring,\]and the right hand term describes a string in $\RM$ by theconstructor.  This proves $P(s)$, as required.\textbf{Constructor case:}($s = ab$ for $a,b \in \AM$).Assume that $s = ab$ for $a, b \in \AM$.  We may assume $P(a)$ and$P(b)$ are true By induction hypothesis.  Therefore, $a,b \in \RM$.By part~\eqref{RMcat}, we conclude that $ab \in \RM$.  This proves$P(s)$, as required.We conclude by structural induction that $\forall s \in \AM.\, s \in\RM$, or equivalently, $\AM \subseteq \RM$.\end{solution}\ppart  Prove that $\RM = \AM$.\begin{solution}  All that's needed is a proof that $\RM \subseteq \AM$, since the  converse inclusion was already proved in part~\eqref{AMsubRM}.\begin{proof}It is equivalent to show $\forall s \in \RM, s \in \AM$.  The proof isby structural induction on the definition of $s \in \RM$.\textbf{Induction hypothesis:} $P(s) \eqdef s \in \AM$.\textbf{Base case:} ($s = \emptystring$). $P(s)$ holds since$\emptystring$ is a base case for $\AM$.\textbf{Constructor case:} Assume that $s = \lefbrk a \rhtbrk b$ for$a, b \in \RM$.  We may assume by structural induction that $P(a)$ and$P(b)$ both hold.  We must prove $P(s)$, that is\[\lefbrk a \rhtbrk b \in \AM.\]We know $\lefbrk a \rhtbrk \in \AM$ by the first constructor of$\AM$.  Now since $\lefbrk a \rhtbrk, b \in \AM$, we know $\lefbrk a\rhtbrk b \in \AM$ by the second constructor of $\AM$.  Thus $P(s)$holds.We can conclude by structural induction that $\forall s \in \RM.\, s \in\AM$, or equivalently, $\RM \subseteq \AM$.\end{proof}Since $\AM \subseteq \RM$ and $\RM \subseteq \AM$, it follows that $\RM= \AM$.\end{solution}\eparts\end{problem}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem ends here%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\endinput
