\ppart Prove that the set \RM of matched strings\inbook{ of
  Definition~\bref{RM_def}} is closed under string
concatenation.\inhandout{\footnote{The set $\RM$ of strings of brackets
    is defined recursively as follows:
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Base case:} $\emptystring \in\RM$.

\item \textbf{Constructor case:} If $s,t \in \RM$, then $\lefbrk s\, \rhtbrk t \in \RM.$
\end{itemize}}}
Namely, if $s,t \in \RM$, then $s\cdot t \in \RM$.

\begin{solution}
The proof is by structural induction on the definition of $s \in \RM$.

\textbf{TBA}

\end{solution}

\ppart\label{AMsubRM}  Prove $\AM \subseteq \RM$, where \AM\ is the set of ambiguous
matched strings\inbook{ of Definition~\bref{AM_def}}.\inhandout{\footnote{
The set, $\AM \subseteq \brkts$ is defined recursively as follows:
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Base case:} $\emptystring \in \AM$,

\item \textbf{Constructor cases:} if $s,t \in \AM$, then
  the strings $\lefbrk s\, \rhtbrk$ and $st$ are also in $\AM$.
\end{itemize}
}}

\begin{solution}
The proof is by structural induction on the definition of $s \in \AM$.

\textbf{TBA}

\end{solution}

\ppart  Prove that $\RM = \AM$.

\begin{solution}
  All that's needed is a proof that $\RM \subseteq \AM$, since the
  converse inclusion was already proved in part~\eqref{AMsubRM}.

\begin{proof}
The proof is by structural induction on the definition of $s \in \RM$.

\textbf{TBA}

\end{proof}
