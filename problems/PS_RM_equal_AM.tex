We may assume by structural induction that $P(a)$ and $P(b)$ both hold. We must prove $P(s)$, that is\[ \forall t \in \RM, s \cdot t \in \RM. \]For all $t$ we have\[ s \cdot t = \lefbrk a \rhtbrk b t. \]If $t \in \RM$, then $bt \in \RM$ by the induction hypothesis. Now since $a, bt \in \RM$, we have $\lefbrk a \rhtbrk b t$ is in $\RM$ by the constructor. Thus, $s \cdot t \in \RM$ if $t \in \RM$. This proves $P(s)$.By structural induction, we can conclude\[ \forall s \in \RM, P(s) \]or equivalently,\[ \forall s, t \in \RM, s \cdot t \in \RM \]\end{solution}\ppart\label{AMsubRM}  Prove $\AM \subseteq \RM$, where \AM\ is the set of ambiguousmatched strings\inbook{ of Definition~\bref{AM_def}}.\inhandout{\footnote{The set, $\AM \subseteq \brkts$ is defined recursively as follows:\begin{itemize}\item \textbf{Base case:} $\emptystring \in \AM$,\item \textbf{Constructor cases:} if $s,t \in \AM$, then  the strings $\lefbrk s\, \rhtbrk$ and $st$ are also in $\AM$.\end{itemize}}}\begin{solution}It is equivalent to show $\forall s \in \AM, s \in \RM$. The proof is by structural induction on the definition of $s \in \AM$.\textbf{Induction hypothesis:} $P(s) ::= s \in \RM$.\textbf{Base case:} ($s = \emptystring$). We know $P(s)$ holds since $\emptystring$ is a base case for $\RM$.\textbf{Constructor cases:} There are two constructor cases to consider for $\AM$, $s = \lefbrk a \rhtbrk$ and $s = ab$.Assume that $s = \lefbrk a \rhtbrk$ for $a \in \AM$. We may assume by structural induction that $P(a)$ holds. We must prove $P(s)$. Note that\[ s = \lefbrk a \rhtbrk = \lefbrk a \rhtbrk \emptystring. \]Thus we know that $s \in \RM$ since $a \in \RM$ (by the induction hypothesis) and $\emptystring \in \RM$, by the constructor case for $\RM$. Hence, $P(s)$ holds for this constructor case.Assume that $s = ab$ for $a, b \in \AM$. We may assume by structural induction that $P(a)$ and $P(b)$ both hold. We must prove $P(s)$. Note that in part~\eqref{RMcat} we proved that if $a, b \in \RM$ then $ab \in \RM$. Thus, $P(s)$, since $a,b \in \RM$ by the induction hypothesis.For both constructor cases, we showed $P(s)$.We can conclude by structural induction that $\forall s \in \AM, s \in \RM$, or equivalently, $\AM \subseteq \RM$.\end{solution}\ppart  Prove that $\RM = \AM$.\begin{solution}  All that's needed is a proof that $\RM \subseteq \AM$, since the  converse inclusion was already proved in part~\eqref{AMsubRM}.\begin{proof}It is equivalent to show $\forall s \in \RM, s \in \AM$. The proof is by structural induction on the definition of $s \in \RM$.\textbf{Induction hypothesis:} $P(s) ::= s \in \AM$.\textbf{Base case:} ($s = \emptystring$). $P(s)$ holds since $\emptystring$ is a base case for $\AM$.\textbf{Constructor case:} Assume that $s = \lefbrk a \rhtbrk b$ for $a, b \in \RM$. We may assume by structural induction that $P(a)$ and $P(b)$ both hold. We must prove $P(s)$, that is\[ \lefbrk a \rhtbrk b \in \AM. \]We know $\lefbrk a \rhtbrk \in \AM$ by the first constructor of $\AM$. Now since $\lefbrk a \rhtbrk, b \in \AM$, we know $\lefbrk a \rhtbrk b \in \AM$ by the second constructor of $\AM$. Thus $P(s)$ holds. We can conclude by structural induction that $\forall s \in \RM, s \in \AM$, or equivalently, $\RM \subseteq \AM$.\end{proof}Since $\AM \subseteq \RM$ and $\RM \subseteq \AM$, $\RM = \AM$.\end{solution}\eparts\end{problem}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem ends here%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\endinput
