\begin{problem}

Prove the following claim:

Suppose there is a positive length walk in digraph $G$ that starts and ends at node $v$. Then, $G$ has a positive length cycle. \\

Recall a cycle is a walk whose only repeat vertex is the start and end vertex.

\begin{solution}
The set $L$ of {\em lengths} of all positive-length walks starting and ending in $v$ is a set of non-negative integers and is non-empty, since from the hypothesis we know of at least one cycle.  
By the Well ordering principle, there exist a smallest $n_0 \in L$. Consider any walk in $G$ with length $n_{\mbox{min}}$. We prove it is a cycle.

Suppose for the purpose of contradiction that some walk of size $n_{\mbox{min}}$ is not a cycle, then there is a repeated node $x$ in the walk,  in additio to $v$ (the start and end vertex).
The walk looks like 

$$v,\dots ,x,\dots ,y,x,\dots ,v$$

 where $x \neq v$. If we remove the segment $x, \cdots ,y$ we again have a valid, still positive length walk of length $0 < n' < n_{\hbox{min}}$, a contradiction.
\end{solution}
