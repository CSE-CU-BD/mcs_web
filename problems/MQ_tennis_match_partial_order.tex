\begin{problem}
A tennis tournament consists of a series of matches between two
players.  Usually the objective is to determine a single best player
among a set of players.  The organizers of the Math for Computer
Science tournament want to do more: they want to find a linear ranking
of all the players.  To avoid controversy, they want to avoid the
awkward situation of having a sequence of players each of whom beats
the next player in the sequence and then having last player beat the
first.  So the organizers will keep a running record of who beat whom
during the tournament and never allow simultaneous matches whose
outcomes could lead to an awkward situation.

Knowledge of binary relations can help the organizers in arranging the
tournament.  Namely, at any stage of the tournament, the organizers
have a record of who lost to whom.  Mathematically, we can say that
there is a binary relation, $L$, on players where $p\mrel{L}q$ means
that player $p$ lost a match to player $q$.  No awkward situations
means that the positive length walk relation, $L^+$, is a strict
partial order.  Indicate which of the following partial order concepts
correspond to the properties~\eqref{unbeat}--\eqref{noloseself} of the
partial order $L^+$.

\bparts
\ppart\label{unbeat} An unbeaten player is a \brule{1in} element.
\begin{solution}
maximal
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{lostall} A player who has lost every match he was in is a
\brule{1in} element.
\begin{solution}
minimal
\end{solution}

\ppart A player who is sure to rank first at the end of the tournament is
a \brule{1in} element.
\begin{solution}
maximum
\end{solution}

\ppart A set of players whose rankings relative to each other are unique is \brule{1in}.
\begin{solution}
a chain
\end{solution}

\ppart Two players can be matched in the next stage of the
tournament only if they are \brule{1in} elements.
\begin{solution}
incomparable
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{finalrank} The final ranking at the end of the tournament will be
\brule{1in}.

\begin{solution}
a topological sort
\end{solution}

\ppart A set of players any two of whom could be paired up to play
the next match is \brule{1in}.
\begin{solution}
an antichain
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{noloseself} The fact that no player loses to himself corresponds to $L^+$ being
\brule{1in}.  
\begin{solution}
irreflexive
\end{solution}

\eparts

For the following parts, assume there are 256 players in the tournament.

\ppart Assuming each match takes an hour and matches are scheduled to be
played simultaneously on the hour, what is the smallest number of hours the
tournament could take?  \examrule
