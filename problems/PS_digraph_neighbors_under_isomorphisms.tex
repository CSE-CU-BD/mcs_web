\begin{problem}
Let $G$ be a digraph.  Note that the set of endpoints of the edges out
of a vertex $v \in \vertices{G}$ is the image, $\edges{G}(v)$ of $v$
under the edge relation of $G$.

\bparts

\ppart\label{digr-fhat}  
Suppose $f$ is an isomorphism from $G$ to another digraph $H$.
Prove that
\[
f(\edges{G}(v)) = \edges{H}(f(v)).
\]

Your proof should follow by simple reasoning using the definitions of
isomorphism and image of a vertex under the edge relation---no
pictures or handwaving.

\hint Prove by a chain of iff's that
\[
h \in \edges{H}(f(v)) \QIFF\ h \in f(\edges{G}(v))
\]
for every $h \in \vertices{H}$.  Use the fact that $h=f(u)$ for some
$u \in \vertices{G}$.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $h \in \vertices{H}$.  By definition of isomorphism, there is
a unique $u \in \vertices{G}$ such that $f(u)=h$.  Then
\begin{align*}
h \in \edges{H}(f(v))
    & \QIFF\ \diredge{f(v)}{h} \in \edges{H}          & \text{(def of $\edges{H}(f(v))$)}\\
    & \QIFF\ \diredge{f(v)}{f(u)} \in \edges{H}       & \text{(def of $u$)}\\
    & \QIFF\ \diredge{v}{u} \in \edges{V}             & \text{(since $f$ is an isomorphism)}\\
    & \QIFF\ u \in \edges{G}(v)                      & \text{(def of $\edges{G}(v)$)}\\
    & \QIFF\ f(u) \in f(\edges{G}(v))                & \text{(def of $f$-image)}\\
    & \QIFF\ h \in f(\edges{G}(v))                   & \text{(def of $u$)}
\end{align*}
So $\edges{H}(f(v))$ and $f(\edges{G}(v))$ have the same members and
therefore are equal.

\end{proof}
\end{solution}

\ppart Conclude that if $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic graphs, then they
have the same number of vertices of out-degree $k$, for all $k \in
\naturals$.
\hint $\outdegr{v} \eqdef \card{\edges{G}(v)}$.

\begin{solution}
Since an isomorphism is a bijection, any set of vertices and its image
under an isomorphism will be the same size (Bijection Mapping
Rule~\bref{bij_same_fincard}).  So part~\eqref{digr-fhat} implies that
an isomorphism, $f$, maps out-degree $k$ vertices to out-degree $k$
vertices.  This means that the image under $f$ of the set of
out-degree $k$ vertices of $G$ is precisely the set of out-degree $k$
vertices of $H$.  So by the Mapping Rule again, there are the same
number of out-degree $k$ vertices in $G$ and $H$.
\end{solution}
