\begin{problem}
Use induction to prove that there are $2^n$ subsets of an $n$-element
set (Theorem~\bref{powset_fincard}).  

\begin{solution}
Let $n$ be a positive integer.  We define the Induction Hypothesis,
$P(n)$, be the statement that every $n$-element set has $2^n$ subsets.

\inductioncase{Base case}: ($n=0$).  The empty set has exactly $2^0 =
1$ subset, namely, itself.

\textbf{Induction step:} Assume that $P(m)$ is true for some $m \in
\naturals$, and suppose $A$ is a set with $m+1$ elements.  Choose an
element $a \in A$ and let $B \eqdef A - \set{a}$.  Now $B$ is an
$m$-element set which has $2^m$ subsets by Induction Hypothesis.

Now, let us count the number of subsets of $A$ as follows.  Consider
any set $C \subset A$.  There are two disjoint cases: (i) $a \not\in
C$, in which case $C \subset B$ and there are $2^m$ possible choices
for $C$; (ii) $a \in C$, in which case $C = C' \union \set{a}$ where
$C' \subset B$ and again, there are $2^m$ possible choices for $C'$.
Therefore, the total number of choices for $C$ is given by $2^m + 2^m
= 2^{m+1}$.  This proves $P(m+1)$, completing the induction step.
