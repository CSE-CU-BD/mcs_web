\ppart[3] How many POSITIVE integer solutions are there to the equation $x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4+x_5 = 20$?
\examspace[2in]

\begin{solution}
$19C4$. We are basically doing the donut problem with 15 donuts and 5 people. We have 15 donuts because each person has already been given one because each person eats a positive number of donuts.\end{solution}

\ppart[3] How many nonnegative integer solutions are there to the same equation where $x_1, ..., x_5$ are all even?
\examspace[2in]

\begin{solution}
$14C4$. This is the same problem as having five numbers that add up to 10, where each number is nonnegative. There is a bijection because we can simply multiply each number by 2 to get what we are trying to count.\end{solution}

\ppart[3] How many nonnegative integer solutions are there to the same equation where $x_1, ..., x_5$ are all odd?
\examspace[2in]

\begin{solution}
0. If all five numbers are odd, their sum is odd.
\end{solution}
