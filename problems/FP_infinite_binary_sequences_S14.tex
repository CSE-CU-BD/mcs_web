\begin{solution}
Add an infinite sequence of $\mtt{0}$'s to the end of a finite sequence
to make it into and infinite sequence with only finitely many
$\mtt{1}$'s.  That is $x \in \finbin$ maps to $x 0^\omega \in F$.
\end{solution}

\ppart The set $\bar{F} \eqdef \binw - F$ consists of all the infinite
binary sequences with \emph{infinitely} many $\mtt{1}$'s.  Use the
previous problem part\inhandout{s} to prove that $\bar{F}$ is
uncountable.

\hint We know that $\finbin$ is countable and $\binw$ is not.

\begin{solution}
By part~\eqref{binwsurjbarF}, we have $\finbin \surj F$, and so $F$ is
countable (Lemma~\bref{NsurjC}).  Now if $\bar{F}$ was also countable,
then by
\inbook{Lemma~\bref{TP_union_two_countable}}
\inhandout{part~\eqref{unioncount}},
$F \union \bar{F} = \binw$ would be countable, a contradiction.

There is also a simple diagonal argument that proves that $\bar{F}$ is
uncountable using a $30^o$ diagonal instead of the basic $45^o$
diagonal.  Suppoosing there was a list of the elements of $\bar{F}$,
define a ``diagonal'' sequence, $s$, that differs from the $n$th
sequence in the list at position $\mathbf{2}n$.  This still ensures
that $s$ is not in the list, but it leaves all the odd numbered bits
of $s$ unspecified.  So we can define all the odd numbered bits of $s$
to be 1, guaranteeing that $s$ has infinitely many 1's.

\begin{staffnotes}
Consider why the usual $45^o$ diagonal argument does not work here.
If $s'$ is the diagonal sequence that differs from the $n$th sequence
in the list at position $n$, for all $n \in \naturals$, then $s'$ is
not in the list, \emph{but there is no guarantee that $s'$ has
  infinitely many 1's}.  So the diagonalization may not yield a
``missing'' sequence, and the proof breaks down.
