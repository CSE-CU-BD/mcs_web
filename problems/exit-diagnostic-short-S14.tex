\ppart In a small village there live 20 families. 4 families have 1
child each,  5 families have 2 children with different ages each,  2
families have twins, 3 families have 3 children each, and 1 family has 4 children.

\ppart For each of the following formulas, state whether it is valid
or not.

\begin{romanlist}
\item $\QNOT(\forall x \in A) P(x) \QIFF (\exists x \in A) \QNOT
  \left(P(x) \right) $; $A$ is a set.
\item $P(x) \QAND \QNOT(Q(x)) \QIFF \QNOT\left( P(x) \QIMPLIES Q(x) \right)$

\item If $y \in \set{1, 2, 3, 4}$ and $P(x, y) = \set{x^2 + y^2 <
    17}$, then $\forall x \, \exists y \, P(x,y)$.
\end{romanlist}

\begin{solution}
valid; valid; not valid; not valid.

\ppart A shooter shoots two bullets at a target. 

The probability that he will hit the target in the first shot is 0.70. If he hits the
target in his first shot, then the probability that he will hit the
target in the second shot is 0.80. If he misses the target in his first shot, then the probability that
he will hit the target in the second shot is $p$. 

Find the value of $p$ if the probability that he will hit the target
in the second shot is 0.62.

\begin{center}
0.80 \qquad 0.62 \qquad 0.20 \qquad 0.56 \qquad Other
\end{center}

\begin{solution}
0.20 .

\ppart George is asked to pick a ball from a jar and guess its color
while blindfolded. The jar contains $n$ green balls and $n$ red balls, all
identical in size and weight. He gets answers from his two friends,
Anna and Sam. Anna is colorblind, so her answer is random. Sam can see
the ball he draws and answers correctly in half of the cases while in
the other half he answers randomly. George is willing to guess if and
only if both his friends agree. If Sam and Anna do not agree, George
returns the ball to the jar and picks another ball until they agree.

What is the probability that George will respond correctly? Please
explain your reasoning.

\begin{center}
\exambox{6.0in}{2.0in}{0in}
\end{center}

\begin{solution}
3/8.

Reasoning: TBA.
