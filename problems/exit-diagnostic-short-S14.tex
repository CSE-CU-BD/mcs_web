probability that:

\begin{romanlist}

\item Not all three moves will succeed?\hfill \examrule[0.7in]

\examspace[0.2in]

\ppart Let $p(n) \eqdef n^2 - 16$.  What is the largest prime factor
of $p(51)$? \hfill \examrule[0.7in]

\ppart A shooter shoots two bullets at a target.  The probability that
he will hit the target in the first shot is 0.70. If he hits the
target in his first shot, then the probability that he will hit the
target in the second shot is 0.80.  If he misses the target in his
first shot, then the probability that he will hit the target in the
second shot is $p$.  Given that the probability that he will hit the
target in the second shot is 0.62, what is $p$?

\TBA{EXPLANATION}
\end{solution}

\ppart A jar contains an equal number of green and red balls, indistinguishable except for color.
George is blindfolded and asked to pick a ball from a jar and guess its color.  As soon as he picks,
his two friends, Anna and Sam, tell him what to answer.  Anna is color blind, so her answer is
random.  Sam can see the ball George draws and answers correctly 3/4 of the time.  If Sam and Anna
do not agree, George returns the ball to the jar without answering and then picks again.  If they do
agree, George will use their answer.

\begin{romanlist}

\item What is the probability that George will give the correct answer when he responds?\hfill
  \examrule[0.6in]

\examspace[0.5in]

\begin{solution}
\textbf{3/4}.

George responds when Anna and Sam agree, so the probability that
George is correct when he responds is the probability that both Anna
and Sam are correct, given that Anna and Sam agree, namely,
\[
\prcond{\text{both correct}}{\text{both agree}}
   = \frac{ \pr{\text{Anna correct}} \pr{\text{Sam correct}}}{\pr{\text{both agree}}}
   = \frac{(1/2)(3/4)}{(1/2)(3/4) + (1/2)(1/4)}
   =\frac{3}{4}\, .
\]

\end{solution}

\item Suppose that there is only a single red ball is in the jar.  Will your previous answer change?
  Explain:

\begin{center}
\exambox{6.0in}{1.0in}{0in}
\end{center}
\begin{solution}
Doesn't matter.  The previous reasoning that led to the 3/4
probability did not depend on how many balls of either color were in
the jar.
