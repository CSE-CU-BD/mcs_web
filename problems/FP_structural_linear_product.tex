\begin{problem}
The set \wtav\ of Weighted Average numbers in the real interval
$[0,1]$ are defined recursively as follows:

\inductioncase{Base cases:} $0,1 \in \wtav$.

\inductioncase{Constructor case:}
If $a,b$ are in \wtav, then so is $L(a,b)$ where
\[
L(a,b) \eqdef \frac{2a+3b}{5}.
\]

\bparts
\ppart Prove by induction that
\[
\paren{\frac{2}{5}}^n \in \wtav
\]
for all nonnegative integers $n$.

\ppart Prove using the Well-Ordering Principle that
\[
\paren{\frac{2}{5}}^n \in \wtav
\]
for all nonnegative integers $n$.

\ppart Prove by Structural Induction that the product of two Weighted
Average numbers is also a Weighted Average number.

\hint
\[
P(c) \eqdef \forall d \in \wtav.\ c \cdot d \in \wtav.
\]

\begin{solution}
\inductioncase{Base cases:} $P(0)$ holds since $0\cdot b = 0 \in
\wtav$.  Likewise, $P(1)$ holds since $1 \cdot b = b \in \wtav$.

\inductioncase{Constructor case:} ($c = L(a,b)$ for $a,b \in \wtav$).
So
\[
c \cdot d = \frac{2a+3b}{5} \cdot d = \frac{2(ad)+3(bd)}{5} = L(ad, bd).
\]
Now $ad, bd \in wtav$ by structural induction hypothesis, and
therefore $c\cdot d =L(ad,bd) \in \wtav$ by construction.
\end{solution}
