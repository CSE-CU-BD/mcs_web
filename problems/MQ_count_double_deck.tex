\begin{problem}
  Suppose that two identical 52-card decks are mixed together.  Write a
  simple formula for the number of 104-card double-deck mixes that are
  possible.

%\examspace[3in]

\begin{solution}
  If the cards were all distinct, there would be $104!$ ``distinct" mixes.
  Call two distinct mixes \emph{similar} if they differ only in that the
  positions of the two distinct copies of the same card are exchanged.  So
  two distinct mixes correspond to the same double-deck mix iff they are
  similar.  Therefore, the map from distinct mixes to double-deck mixes is
  $(2!)^{52}$ to one, and so by the division rule, there are
\[
\frac{104!}{(2!)^{52}}
\]
double-deck mixes.
\end{solution}
