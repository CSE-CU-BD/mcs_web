CanTeam 2 do better?  The answer is ``no,'' because Team 1 has a strategythat guarantees that it wins at least 3/7 of the time, no matter howTeam 2 plays.  Describe such a strategy for Team 1 and explain why itworks.\begin{solution}Team 1 should randomly choose a number $Z \in \set{0,\dots,6}$ andwrite $Z$ and $Z+1$ on the pieces of paper with all numbers equallylikely.To see why this works, let $N$ be the number on the paper that Team 2turns over, and let $\text{OK}$ be the event that $N \in\set{1,\dots,6}$.  So given event $\text{OK}$, that is, given that $N\in \set{1,\dots,6}$, Team 1's strategy ensures that half the time $N$is the higher number and half the time $N$ is the lower number.  Sogiven event $\text{OK}$, the probability that Team 1 wins is exactly1/2 \emph{no matter how Team 2 chooses to play} (stick or switch).Now we claim that\begin{equation}\label{N}  \pr{\text{OK}} = \frac{6}{7},\end{equation}which implies that the probability that Team 1 wins is indeed at least$(1/2)(6/7)=3/7$.To prove $\pr{\text{OK}}=6/7$, we can follow the four step method.(Note that we couldn't apply this method to model the behavior of Team2, since we don't know how they may play, and so we can't let ouranalysis depend on what they do.)The first level of the probability tree for this game will describethe value of $Z$: there are seven branches from the root with equalprobability going to first level nodes corresponding to the sevenpossible values of $Z$.  The second level of the tree describes thechoice of the number, $N$: each of the seven first-level nodes has twobranches with equal probability, one branch for the case that $N=Z$and the other for the case that $N=Z+1$.  So there are 14 outcome(leaf) nodes at the second level of the tree, each with probability1/14.\begin{center}  \mfigure{!}{3.5in}{figures/probtree}\end{center}Now only two outcomes are not $\text{OK}$, namely, when $Z=6$ and $N=7$,and when $Z=0$ and $N=0$.  Each of the other twelve outcomes is$\text{OK}$, and since each has probability 1/14, we conclude that$\pr{\text{OK}}=12/14=6/7$, as claimed.  \end{solution}\end{problem}%part of problem from fall 05 cp13w %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem ends here%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\endinput
