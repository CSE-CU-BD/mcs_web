One is complete, but the other ismissing the ace of spades.  Suppose you pick one of the two decks withequal probability and then select a card from that deck uniformly atrandom.  What is the probability that you picked the complete deck,given that you selected the eight of hearts?  Use the four-step methodand a tree diagram.\begin{solution}
Let $C$ be the event that you pick the completedeck, and let $H$ be the event that you select the eight of hearts.In these terms, our aim is to compute:\begin{equation*}\prcond{C}{H} = \frac{\pr{C \cap H}}{\pr{H}}\end{equation*}A tree diagram is worked out below:\bigskip\centerline{\resizebox{!}{3in}{\includegraphics{figures/incomplete-deck}}}\bigskipNow we can compute the desired conditional probability as follows:\begin{align*}\prcond{C}{H} & = \frac{\pr{C \cap H}}{\pr{H}} \\              & = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{52}}                       {\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{52} +                        \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{51}} \\              & = \frac{51}{103} \\              & = 0.495146\ldots\end{align*}Thus, if you selected the eight of hearts, then the deck you picked ismore likely to be incomplete.
\end{solution}\end{problem}
