\begin{problem}%\label{generprob}
The formula
\begin{align*}
\QNOT(\bar{X} \QIMPLIES Y) & \QAND X \QAND W\\
                           & \QIMPLIES\\
         Z \QAND U \QAND V & \QAND R \QAND S \QAND T \QAND A \QAND B \QAND C \QAND D
\end{align*}
turns out to be valid.

\begin{problemparts}
\problempart Explain why verifying the validity of this formula
\emph{by truth table} would be very hard for one person to do with
pencil and paper (no computers).

\examspace[1.0in]

\begin{solution}
The number of entries in a truth table here would be $2^{14}$ or about
16,000 since there are 14 variables.  This could take weeks for one
person to do by hand.
\end{solution}

\problempart Verify that the formula is valid reasoning by
cases according to the truth value of $X$.

\begin{proof}
\inductioncase{Case}: ($X$ is \True).
\examspace[1.0in]

\begin{solution}
Since the implication $\overline{\True} \QIMPLIES Y$ is \True, the
expression $\QNOT(\overline{X} \QIMPLIES Y)$ evaluates to \False.  So
the hypothesis (upper formula) of the main implication is \False,
making the whole implication formula \True.  So the formula is
\True\ in all assignments with $X$ assigned \True.
\end{solution}

\inductioncase{Case}: ($X$ is \False). 
\examspace[1.0in]

\begin{solution}
The hypothesis (upper formula) side of the formula is now equivalent
to $(\False\ \QAND \dots)$, and so is immediately \False.  As in the
previous case, this makes the whole implication formula \True.  So the
formula is \True\ in all assignments with $X$ assigned \False.

\medskip
Since $X$ must be \True\ or \False\ in any truth assignment, the
formula is \True\ in any case.  That is, it is valid.
\end{solution}

\end{proof}
