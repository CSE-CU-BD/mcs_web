\begin{problem}
We revisit Sauron, Voldemort, and Bunny Foo Foo as in the class
problem.  As before, the guard is going to release exactly two of the
three prisoners; he's equally likely to release any set of two
prisoners.
The guard offers to tell Voldemort the name of one of the
prisoners to be released.  The guard’s rule for which name he chooses:\\
1. the guard will never say that Voldemort will be released.\\
2. if both Foo Foo and Sauron are getting released, the guard will
always give Foo Foo’s name.\\
We’re interested in which characters are released, and in which character the guard says will be released.

\begin{problemparts}
\problempart
Draw a tree to represent the sample space.  indicate, in your drawing, which outcomes correspond to the following events: \\
i. the guard tells voldemort that foo foo will be released \\
ii. the guard tells voldemort that sauron will be released \\
iii. voldemort is released \\

\problempart %B
What is the probability that Voldemort is released, given that the guard says Foo-foo will be released?

\begin{solution}
$\frac{1}{2}$
\end{solution}

\problempart %C

What is the probability Voldemort is released, given that the guard says Sauron will be released?

\begin{solution}
$1$
\end{solution}

\problempart %D

Show, with a calculation, that Voldemort's probability of being released is unchanged by the guard telling him which other character is released.

\begin{solution}

Still 2/3, by law of total probability.

$P(\texttt{released}) = $ \\
$P(\texttt{released} | \texttt{says foofoo})P(\texttt{says foofoo}) + $\\
$P(\texttt{released} | \texttt{says sauron})P(\texttt{says sauron})$

\end{solution}
