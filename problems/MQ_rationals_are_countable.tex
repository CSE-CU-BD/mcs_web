\begin{problem}
  Let A and B denote two countably infinite sets:
  \[ A=\left{a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots\right} \]
  \[ B=\left{b_0,b_1,b_2,\ldots\right} \]
  Show that their Cartesian product, $A\timesB$, is also a countable set 
  by showing that it is possible to form a list of all the elements of $A\timesB$.
