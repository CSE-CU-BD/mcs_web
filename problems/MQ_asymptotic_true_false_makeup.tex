\begin{problem}
Circle each of the true statements below. 

Explanations are not required, but partial credit for wrong answers will not be given without them. 

\begin{itemize}

\item $\displaystyle n = \Theta \left(\frac{3n^3}{(n+1)(n-1)}\right)$

\item $\displaystyle n^2 \sim n^{2} + n$

\item $\displaystyle 3^n=O\left(2^n\right)$

\item $\displaystyle \ln \left(\left(n^2\right)!\right) = O\left(n^2\ln(n)\right)$ 

%\item $\displaystyle n^{\sin (n\pi/2) + 1} = o\left(n^2\right)$

\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}The 1st and 4th statements are true.\end{solution}
