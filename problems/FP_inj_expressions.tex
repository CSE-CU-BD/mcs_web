%\textbf{Injections and Cardinality.}

Let $f:D \to D$ be a total function from some nonempty set $D$
to itself.  In the following propositions, $x$ and $y$ are variables
ranging over $D$, and $g$ is a variable ranging over total functions
from $D$ to $D$.  \inhandout{Circle} \inbook{Indicate} all of the
propositions that are equivalent to the proposition that $f$ is an
\emph{injection}. \inhandout{No explanations are necessary.}

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $\forall x\forall y (x = y \QOR f(x) \neq f(y))$
\item $\forall x\forall y (x = y \QIMPLIES f(x) = f(y))$
\item $\forall x\forall y (x \neq y \QIMPLIES f(x) \neq f(y))$
\item $\forall x\forall y (f(x) = f(y) \QIMPLIES x = y)$
%\item $\forall x \forall y(f(x) \neq f(y))$
\item $\QNOT[\exists x\exists y(x \neq y \QAND f(x)= f(y))]$
\item $\QNOT[\exists z\in D \forall x(f(x) \neq z)]$
\item $\exists g \forall x (g(f(x))=x)$
\item $\exists g \forall x (f(g(x))=x)$

We have proved that the infinite set of real numbers is ``strictly
bigger'' than the infinite set of integers, and the set of integers is
``strictly bigger'' than any finite set.

\bparts

\ppart  State precisely what it means to say a set $A$ is ``strictly
bigger'' than another set $B$.

\begin{solution}
There is no injection from $A$ to $B$.  Alternatively, there is no
bijection between $A$ and $B$, while there is an injection from $B$ to
$A$.
\end{solution}

\examspace{1.5in}

\ppart Give an example of a set that is strictly bigger than the set
of real numbers.

\begin{solution}
$A \eqdef P(\reals)$.
\end{solution}
