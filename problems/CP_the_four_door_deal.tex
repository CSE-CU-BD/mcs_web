Now there are \textbf{four} doors, with a prize hiddenbehind one of them.  The contestant is allowed to pick a door.  Thehost must then reveal a different door that has no prize behind it.The contestant is allowed to stay with his or her original door or topick one of the other two that are still closed.  If the contestantchooses the door concealing the prize in this second stage, then he orshe wins.\bparts\ppart Contestant Stu, a sanitation engineer from Trenton, New Jersey,stays with his original door.  What is the probability that he winsthe prize?The tree diagram is awkwardly large.  This often happens; in fact,sometimes you'll encounter \textit{infinite} tree diagrams!  Try todraw enough of the diagram so that you understand the structure of theremainder.\begin{solution}Let's make the same assumptions as in the originalproblem:%\begin{enumerate}\item The prize is equally likely to be behind each door.\item The contestant is equally likely to pick each door initially,regardless of the prize's location.\item The host is equally likely to reveal each door that does notconceal the prize and was not selected by the player.\end{enumerate}%A partial tree diagram is shown below.  The remaining subtrees aresymmetric to the fully-expanded subtree.%\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=6in]{figures/four-door}\end{center}%The probability that Stu wins the prize is:%\[\pr{\text{Stu wins}} = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{48} + \frac{1}{48} + \frac{1}{48}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\]%We multiply by 4 to account for the four subtrees, of which we've onlydrawn one.Notice that we expanded the tree out to the third (``door revealed'')level to spell out the outcomes, but in this case we could, in fact, havestopped at the second level (``player's initial guess'').  This followsbecause the win/lose outcome is determined by the prize location and Stu'sselected door, regardless of what happens after that.\end{solution}\ppart Contestant Zelda, an alien abduction researcher from Helena,Montana, switches to one of the remaining two doors with equalprobability.  What is the probability that she wins the prize?\begin{solution}A partial tree diagram is worked out below.%\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=6in]{figures/four-doorb}\end{center}%The probability that Zelda wins the prize is:%\[\pr{\text{Zelda wins}} = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{64} + \frac{1}{64} + \frac{1}{64} + \frac{1}{64} + \frac{1}{64} + \frac{1}{64} \right) = \frac{3}{8}\]\end{solution}\eparts\end{problem}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem ends here%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\endinput
