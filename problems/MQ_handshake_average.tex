\begin{problem}
We claim that the average degree of a vertex in an $n$-vertex graph is
twice the average number of edges per vertex, that is, $2\card{E}/n$.
Prove it.

\begin{solution}
The average degree of a vertex is by definition the sum of the degrees
divided by $n$.  The Handshake Lemma say that the sum of the degrees
is $2\card{E}$, so dividing these two quantities by $n$ proves the claim.
\end{solution}
