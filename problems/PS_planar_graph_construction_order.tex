\ppart Prove %Lemma~\bref{switch-edges}.

\begin{lemma*}[Switch Edges] %\label{switch-edges}
 Suppose that,
  starting from some embeddings of planar graphs with disjoint sets of
  vertices, it is possible by two successive applications of constructor
  operations to add edges $e$ and then $f$ to obtain a planar embedding,
  $\embed{F}$.  Then starting from the same embeddings, it is also
  possible to obtain $\embed{F}$ by adding $f$ and then $e$ with two
  successive applications of constructor operations.
\end{lemma*}

\hint There are four cases to analyze,
  depending on which two constructor operations are applied to add $e$ and
  then $f$.  Structural induction is not needed.

\ppart Prove % Corollary~\bref{permute-edges}.

\begin{corollary*}[Permute Edges]  %\label{permute-edges}

Suppose that, starting from some embeddings of planar graphs with
disjoint sets of vertices, it is possible to add a sequence of edges
$e_0,e_1,\dots,e_n$ by successive applications of constructor
operations to obtain a planar embedding, $\embed{F}$.  Then starting
from the same embeddings, it is also possible to obtain $\embed{F}$ by
applications of constructor operations that successively add any
permutation\footnote{If $\pi:\set{0,1,\dots,n} \to \set{0,1,\dots,n}$
  is a bijection, then the sequence
  $e_{\pi(0)},e_{\pi(1)},\dots,e_{\pi(n)}$ is called a
  \term{permutation} of the sequence $e_0,e_1,\dots,e_n$.} of the
edges $e_0,e_1,\dots,e_n$.
\end{corollary*}

\hint By induction on the number of switches of adjacent elements needed
to convert the sequence 0,1,\dots,$n$ into a permutation
$\pi(0),\pi(1),\dots,\pi(n)$.

\ppart Prove 

\begin{corollary*}[Delete Edge] %\label{delete-edge}
Deleting an edge from a planar graph leaves a planar graph.
\end{corollary*}
\begin{solution}

\begin{proof}
  By Corollary [Permute Edges], we may assume the deleted edge was the
  last one added in constructing an embedding of the graph.  So the
  embedding to which this last edge was added must be an embedding of the
  graph without that edge.
\end{proof}

\end{solution}

\begin{editingnotes}
  \href{http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring09/ln6.pdf#switch.edges}
  {Lemma 7.8} in Notes 6 established a key property of planar embeddings:
  two edges that could be successively added to an embedding can be added
  in either order.  Carefully prove this property for the case that the
  two edges are both added by the split-a-face constructor.
