\begin{problem}
  There are two isomorphisms between these two graphs.  Describe as many
  as you can.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=3in]{figures/iso_graphs_afternoon.pdf}
\end{center}

\begin{solution}
These are the vertex correspondences for the two isomorphisms: \\
1A, 2B, 3C, 4D, 5E \\
1C, 2B, 3A, 4E, 5D
\end{solution}
