\begin{problem}
  There are four isomorphisms between these two graphs.  Describe as many
  as you can.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=3in]{figures/iso_graphs_afternoon.pdf}
\end{center}

\begin{solution}
These are the vertex correspondences for the four isomorphisms: \\
1A, 2B, 3C, 4D, 5E \\
1A, 2D, 3C, 4B, 5E \\
1E, 2B, 3C, 4D, 5A \\
1E, 2D, 3C, 4B, 5A
\end{solution}
