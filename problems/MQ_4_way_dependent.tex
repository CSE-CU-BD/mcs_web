\begin{problem}

Suppose there are 4 desks in a classroom, laid out in the corners of a
square as:

picture with 4 labelled desks

Each desk is occupied by a male with probability $p>0$ or a female
with probability $q \eqdef 1-p > 0$.  A male and a female \emph{flirt}
when they occupy desks in adjacent corners of the square.  Let
$I_{12},I_{23},I_{34},I_{41}$ be the indicator whether there is a
flirting couple at the indicated adjacent desks.

\ppart Show that $I_{12}$ and $I_{23}$ are independent iff $p = q$.

\ppart What is the expected number of flirting couples?
\begin{solution}
2. linearity of expectation, or possibly from doing the next part.
\end{solution}

\iffalse
\ppart What is the probability distribution function for the random variable $N$, the number
of flirting pairs.
\begin{solution}
$p_N(0) = 2/16, p_N(1) = 0 p_N(2) = 12/16, p_N(3) = 0, p_N(4) = 2/16$
\end{solution}
