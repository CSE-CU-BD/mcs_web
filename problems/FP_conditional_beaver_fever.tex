\begin{problem}
 There is a rare and incurable disease called Beaver Fever, which
 afflicts about 1 in 1000 people.  Those with this disease unrelentingly tell math jokes in social settings, believing other people would
 think they're funny.  Doctor Meyer has some fairly reliable tests for this disease:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item If a person has Beaver Fever, the probability that Meyer diagnoses
    the person as having the disease is 0.99.

  \item If a person doesn't have it, the probability that Meyer diagnoses
    that person as not having Beaver Fever is 0.97.
  \end{itemize}

  Let $B$ be the event that a randomly chosen person has Beaver Fever,
  and $Y$ be the event that Meyer's diagnosis is ``Yes, that person
  has Beaver Fever,'' with $\bar{B}$ and $\bar{Y}$ being the complements of
  these events.

\ppart\label{explicitly_given}  The description above explicitly gives the values of the
  following quantities.  What are their values?

\begin{center}
$\prob{B}$ \qquad $\prcond{Y}{B}$ \qquad $\prcond{\bar{Y}}{\bar{B}}$ 
\end{center}

\begin{solution}
$\prob{B} = 0.001$ \qquad $\prcond{Y}{B} = 0.99$ \qquad $\prcond{\bar{Y}}{\bar{B}} = 0.97$
\end{solution}

\ppart Write formulas for $\pr{\bar{B}}$ and $\prcond{Y}{\bar{B}}$
solely in terms of the explicitly given quantities in part (a) - literally use their expressions, not their numeric values.

\begin{center}
\exambox{2.0in}{1.0in}{-0.2in}
\end{center}
%\examspace[1.5in]

\begin{solution}
 $\pr{\bar{B}}= 1 - \pr{B}$,
$\prcond{Y}{\bar{B}} = 1 - \prcond{\bar{Y}}{\bar{B}}$. 
\end{solution}

\ppart Write a formula for the probability that Doctor Meyer
says a person has the disease solely in terms of $\pr{B}$,
$\pr{\bar{B}}$, $\prcond{Y}{B}$ and $\prcond{Y}{\bar{B}}$.


\begin{center}
\exambox{3.0in}{0.75in}{-0.2in}
\end{center}
%\examspace[1.5in]

\begin{solution}
By the Total Probability Law:
\[
\pr{Y}=\prcond{Y}{B}\pr{B}+ \prcond{Y}{\bar{B}}\pr{\bar{B}}
\]

The values turn out to be $0.99(1/1000) + 0.03(1- 1/1000) = 0.03096$.

\end{solution}


\ppart Write a formula solely in terms of the expressions given in
part~\eqref{explicitly_given} for the probability that a person has
Beaver Fever given that Doctor Meyer says the person has it.

\begin{center}
\exambox{4.5in}{0.75in}{-0.2in}
\end{center}
%\examspace[2.5in]


\begin{solution}

\begin{align*}
\prcond{B}{Y}
    & = \frac{\pr{B\text{ and }Y}}{\pr{Y}}\\
    & = \frac{\prcond{Y}{B}\pr{B}}{\prcond{Y}{B}\pr{B}+ \prcond{Y}{\bar{B}}\pr{\bar{B}}}\\
    & = \frac{\prcond{Y}{B}\pr{B}}{\prcond{Y}{B}\pr{B}+ (1- \prcond{\bar{Y}}{\bar{B}})(1-\pr{B})}.
\end{align*}

The values turn out to be
\[
\prcond{B}{Y} = \frac{0.99(1/1000)}{0.03096} = \frac{99}{3096} \approx \frac{1}{32}.
\]

The low probability of actually having Beaver Fever even though the (97\% accurate) test says you do is because there are way more people without the disease than those with the disease.  Among 1000 people, the number of false positives $(999 \times 3\%)$ is more than 30 times the number of true positives $(1 \times 99\%)$.  So if the test says you have Beaver Fever, it's probably a false positive.

Of course Doctor Meyer has a recourse to a 99.9\% accurate test that has
no false positives: simply telling everyone they don't have the disease.
\end{solution}
