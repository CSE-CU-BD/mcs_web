\begin{problem}
 There is a rare and serious disease called Beaver Fever which
 afflicts about 1 person in 1000.  Victims of this disease start
 telling math jokes in social settings, believing other people will
 think they're funny.

  Doctor Meyer has some fairly reliable tests for this disease. In
  particular:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item If a person has Beaver Fever, the probability that Meyer diagnoses
    the person as having the disease is 0.99.

  \item If a person doesn't have it, the probability that Meyer diagnoses
    that person as not having Beaver Fever is 0.97.
  \end{itemize}

  Let $B$ be the event that a randomly chosen person has Beaver Fever, and
  $\bar{B}$ be the event that they do not have it.  Let $Y$ be the event
  that Meyer's diagnosis is ``Yes, that person has Beaver Fever,'' and
  $\bar{Y}$ be the event that Meyer's diagnosis is that the person doesn't
  have Beaver Fever.

\ppart  The description above explicitly gives the values of the
  following quantities.  What are their values?

$\prob{B}$ \brule{0.7in} \qquad $\prcond{Y}{B}$ \brule{0.7in} \qquad
  $\prcond{\bar{Y}}{\bar{B}}$ \brule{0.7in}

\ppart Write formulas for $\pr{\bar{B}}$ and $\prcond{Y}{\bar{B}}$
solely in terms of the explicitly given expressions.  Literally use
the expressions, not their numeric values.

\begin{center}
\exambox{1.5in}{0.75in}{-0.2in}

%\examspace[1.5in]

\begin{solution}
 $\pr{\bar{B}}= 1 - \pr{B}$,
$\prcond{Y}{\bar{B}} = 1 - \prcond{\bar{Y}}{\bar{B}}$. 
\end{solution}

\ppart Write a formula for the probability that Doctor Meyer
says a person has the disease solely in terms of $\pr{B}$,
$\pr{\bar{B}}$, $\prcond{Y}{B}$ and $\prcond{Y}{\bar{B}}$.


\begin{center}
\exambox{1.5in}{0.75in}{-0.2in}
\end{center}
%\examspace[1.5in]

\begin{solution}
By the Total Probability Law:
\[
\pr{Y}=\prcond{Y}{B}\pr{B}+ \prcond{Y}{\bar{B}}\pr{\bar{B}}
%        = 0.99(1/1000) + 0.03(1- 1/1000) = 0.03096.
\]
\end{solution}


\ppart Write a formula solely in terms of the explicitly given
quantities for the probability that a person has Beaver Fever given that
Doctor Meyer says the person has it.

\begin{center}
\exambox{4.5in}{0.75in}{-0.2in}

%\examspace[2.5in]


\begin{solution}

\begin{align*}
\prcond{B}{Y}
    & = \frac{\pr{B\text{ and }Y}}{\pr{Y}}\\
    & = \frac{\prcond{Y}{B}\pr{B}}{\prcond{Y}{B}\pr{B}+ \prcond{Y}{\bar{B}}\pr{\bar{B}}}\\
    & = \frac{\prcond{Y}{B}\pr{B}}{\prcond{Y}{B}\pr{B}+ (1- \prcond{\bar{Y}}{\bar{B}})(1-\pr{B})}.
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\prcond{B}{Y}
    & = \frac{\pr{B\text{ and }Y}}{\pr{Y}}\\
    & = \frac{\prcond{Y}{B}\pr{B}}{}\\
    & = \frac{0.99(1/1000)}{0.03096}\\
    & = \frac{99}{3096}\\
    & = \frac{11}{344} \approx \frac{1}{32}.
