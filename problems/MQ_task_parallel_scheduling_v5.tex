\begin{problem}
The following DAG describes the prerequisites among tasks $\set{1, \dots, 9}$.

\ppart If each task takes unit time to complete, what is the minimum
parallel time to complete all the tasks?  Briefly explain.

\begin{center}
\exambox{0.7in}{0.4in}{0in}
\end{center}

\begin{solution}
\textbf{4}.  This is the size of a maximum chain, for example, $1238$.
\end{solution}

\ppart What is the minimum parallel time if no more than two tasks can
be completed in parallel?  Briefly explain.

\begin{solution}
\textbf{5}.  There are 9 tasks and two processors, so time at least $\ceil{9/2} = 5$ is required.
A schedule that achieves this is, $14,26,57,39,8$.
