Members of MITÕs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) are known to thrive on caffeine.  Sixty percent are devoted coffee drinkers, who drink coffee and water exclusively and with equal probability in the lab.  Ten percent are devoted tea drinkers, who drink tea 100% of the time.  Ten percent of lab members are devoted soda drinkers, who drink soda 30\% of the time and water or juice with equal probability the rest of the time.  The remaining twenty percent drink all three types of beverages randomly half of the time, and water and juice with equal probability the rest of the time.

\ppart As a 6.042 student, you go to CSAIL for office hours.  As soon as you get off the elevator, you see two people each holding a cup in front of the white board and discussing something mod something.  What is the probability that both of them are drinking coffee?  

\hint Draw a tree diagram first.
