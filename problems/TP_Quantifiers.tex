\begin{problem}
Let $Q(x, y)$ be the statement 
\begin{center}
    ``$x$ has been a contestant on television show $y$.''  
\end{center}
The universe of discourse for $x$ is the set of all students at your
school and for $y$ is the set of all quiz shows on television.

Determine whether or not each of the following expressions is
logically equivalent to the sentence:

\begin{center}
``No student at your school has ever been a contestant on a television
  quiz show.''
\end{center}

\bparts

\ppart
$\forall x\, \forall y. \; \QNOT (Q(x, y))$

\begin{solution}
Yes.
\end{solution}

\ppart

$\exists x\, \exists y. \; \QNOT (Q(x, y))$

\begin{solution}
No.  This is equivalent to saying ``There is a student who has never been a contestant on at least one television show.''
\end{solution}

\ppart
$\QNOT (\forall x\, \forall y. \; Q(x, y))$

\begin{solution}
No.  This is equivalent to saying ``Not every student has been a
contestant on every television show.''
\end{solution}

\ppart $\QNOT (\exists x\, \exists y . \; Q(x, y)) $

\begin{solution}
Yes.
\end{solution}
