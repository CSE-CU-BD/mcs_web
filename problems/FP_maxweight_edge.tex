\begin{problem}
Let $G$ be a connected simple graph, $T$ be a spanning tree of $G$,
and $e$ be an edge of $G$.  \inhandout{(Note that parts~\eqref{eiscyG}
  and~\eqref{GwtminT} do not depend on part~\eqref{enGeT}.)}

\bparts

\ppart\label{enGeT} Prove that if $e$ \emph{not} on a cycle in $G$, then $e$
is an edge of $T$.

\begin{solution}
If $e$ is not on a cycle in $G$, then $e$ is a cut edge by
Lemma~\bref{lem:cutiffcycle}.  Therefore, $G-e$ is not connected,
which implies that $T-e$ is not connected.  Since $T$ is connected,
$e$ must be an edge of $T$.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{eiscyG} Prove that if $e$ \emph{is} on a cycle in $G$,
then there is an edge $f \neq e$ such that $T - e + f$ is also a
spanning tree.

\begin{solution}
Since $T$ is a tree, $T-e$ has two components.  Since $e$ is on a
cycle in $G$, deleting $e$ from the cycle leaves a path in $G$ between
the endpoints of $e$.  This path connects the two components of $T-e$
and therefore must contain an edge, $f$, other than $e$ that connects
the two components.  Then $T-e+f$ is a also a spanning tree because it
is connected and has the same number of edges as $T$.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{GwtminT} Suppose $G$ is edge-weighted, the weight of $e$
is larger than the weights of all the other edges, and $e$ is an edge
of $T$.  Conclude that $T$ is \emph{not} a minimum weight spanning
tree of $G$.

\begin{solution}
By part~\eqref{eiscyG}, $T-e+f$ is also a spanning tree and its weight
is less than $T$'s since the weight of $f$ is less than the weight of
$e$.
\end{solution}
