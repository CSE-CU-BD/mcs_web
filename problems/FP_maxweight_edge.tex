\begin{problem}
Let $G$ be an edge-weighted connected graph and let $e$ be an edge of
$G$ whose weight is larger than the weights of all the other edges.
Show that if $e$ is on a cycle in $G$, then $e$ is \emph{not} an edge of any
minimum weight spanning tree of $G$.

\begin{solution}
Let $M$ be a spanning tree of $G$ that contains $e$.  We will show
that $M$ is not a minimum weight spanning tree.
