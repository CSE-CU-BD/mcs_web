\begin{problem}
Let $G$ be a connected weighted simple graph and let $v$ be a vertex
of $G$.  Suppose $e \eqdef \edge{v}{w}$ is an edge of $G$ that is
strictly smaller than the weight of every other edge incident to $v$.
Let $T$ be a minimum weight spanning tree of $G$.  Prove that $e$ is
an edge of $T$.  \hint By contradiction.

\begin{solution}
Suppose to the contrary that $e$ is not in $T$.  There is a unique
path, $P$, in $T$ from $v$ to the other endpoint $w$ of $e$.  This
path must start with some edge $f \eqdef \edge{v}{u}$.

Now $T - f + e$ is connected because $v$ is still connected to $u$ by
the path $P-f$ from $u$ to $w$ followed by $e$ from $w$ to $v$.
Therefore $T-f+e$ is also a spanning tree of $G$ since it has the same
number of edges as $T$.

But the weight of $T - f + e$ is smaller than the weight than $T$,
since the weight of $e$ is smaller thatn the weight of $f$,
contradicting that fact that $T$ is a minimum weight spanning tree..
\end{solution}
