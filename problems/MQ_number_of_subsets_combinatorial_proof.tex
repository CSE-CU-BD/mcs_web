\begin{problem}

Find a combinatorial (\emph{not} algebraic) proof that
\[
\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i} = 2^n.
\]

%\hint Think about the binomial theorem.
\begin{solution}
%Both sides are the sum of the coefficients of $(x + y)^n$.

  There are $2^n$ subsets of $\set{1,2,\dots,n}$.  But the number of such
  subsets is sum of the number of subsets of size $k$, namely,
  $\binom{n}{k}$ for $0 \leq k\leq n$.
\end{solution}
