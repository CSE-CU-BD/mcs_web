\begin{problem} A classroom has sixteen desks arranged as shown below.%\begin{center}\begin{picture}(270,198)% \put(0,0){\dashbox(270,198){}} % bounding box\multiput(0,0)(72,0){4}{\framebox(54,36){}}\multiput(0,54)(72,0){4}{\framebox(54,36){}}\multiput(0,108)(72,0){4}{\framebox(54,36){}}\multiput(0,162)(72,0){4}{\framebox(54,36){}}\end{picture}\end{center}%If there is a girl in front, behind, to the left, or to the right of aboy, then the two of them \textit{flirt}.  One student may be inmultiple flirting couples; for example, a student in a corner of theclassroom can flirt with up to two others, while a student in thecenter can flirt with as many as four others.  Suppose that desks areoccupied by boys and girls with equal probability and mutuallyindependently.  What is the expected number of flirting couples?\hint Linearity.\begin{solution}
First, let's count the number of pairs of adjacent desks.There are three in each row and three in each column.  Since there arefour rows and four columns, there are $3 \cdot 4 + 3 \cdot 4 = 24$pairs of adjacent desks.Number these pairs of adjacent desks from 1 to 24.  Let $F_i$ be anindicator for the event that occupants of the desks in the $i$-th pairare flirting.  The probability we want is then:%\begin{align*}\expect{\sum_{i=1}^{24} F_i}	& = \sum_{i=1}^{24} \expect{F_i} & \text{(linearity of $\expect{\cdot}$)}\\	& = \sum_{i=1}^{24} \pr{F_i = 1} & \text{($F_i$ is an indicator)}\end{align*}The occupants of adjacent desks are flirting iff they are of oppositesexes, which happens with probability 1/2, that is, $\pr{F_i = 1} = 1/2$.Plugging this into the previous expression gives:%\[\expect{\sum_{i=1}^{24} F_i}	 = \sum_{i=1}^{24} \pr{F_i = 1}	 = 24 \cdot \frac{1}{2}	 = 12\]\end{solution}\end{problem}
