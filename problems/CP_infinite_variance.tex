\begin{problem}
Let $R$ be a positive integer valued random variable such that
\[
f_R(n)  = \frac{1}{cn^3},
\]
where
\[
c \eqdef \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^3}.
\]

\bparts

\ppart \label{exf} Prove that $\expect{R}$ is finite.

\begin{solution}
	
\begin{align*}
\expect{R} \eqdef & \sum_{n \in \naturals^{+}} n \cdot \frac{1}{cn^3}\\
 = & \sum_{n \in \naturals^{+}} \frac{1}{cn^2}\\
 < &\ 1+\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{cn^2}\\
 = &\ 1 + \frac{1}{2c}\\
< &\ \infty.
\end{align*}

\end{solution}

\ppart
Prove that $\variance{R}$ is infinite.

\begin{solution}
Since
\[
\variance{R} = \expect{R^2} - \expectsq{R},
\]
and $\expectsq{R} < \infty$ by part~(\ref{exf}), we need only show
that $\expect{R^2} = \infty$.  But
\begin{align*}
\expect{R^2} \eqdef & \sum_{n \in \naturals^{+}} n^2\frac{1}{cn^3}\\
 = & \sum_{n \in \naturals^{+}} \frac{1}{cn}\\
 = & \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{c} \cdot H_n\\
 = &\ \infty.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
