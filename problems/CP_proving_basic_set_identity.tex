\emph{Set Formulas and Propositional Formulas.}
\bparts

\ppart\label{verprop}
Verify that the propositional formula $(P \QAND \bar{Q}) \QOR (P \QAND
Q)$ is equivalent to $P$.

\begin{staffnotes}
If students use truth tables, suggest they try again using cases and/or algebra.
\end{staffnotes}

\begin{solution}
There is a simple verification by truth table with 4 rows which we omit.

There is also a simple cases argument: if $Q$ is \true, then the formula
simplifies to $(P \QAND \false) \QOR (P \QAND \true)$ which further
simplifies to $(\false \QOR P)$ which is equivalent to $P$.

Otherwise, if $Q$ is \textcolor{red}{F}, then the formula simplifies to
$(P \QAND \true) \QOR (P \QAND \false)$ which
is likewise equivalent to $P$.

Finally, there is a proof by propositional algebra:
\begin{align*}
(P \QAND \bar{Q}) \QOR (P \QAND Q) & \iff P \QAND (\bar{Q} \QOR Q) & \text{(distributivity)}\\
  & \iff P \QAND \true \iff P.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}

\ppart Prove that\footnote{The \term{set difference}, $A-B$, of sets $A$ and $B$ is
\[
A-B \eqdef \set{a \in A \suchthat a \notin B}.
\]}
\[
A = (A-B) \union (A \intersect B)
\]
for all sets, $A, B$, by using a chain of iff's to show that
\[
x \in A \QIFF x \in (A-B) \union (A \intersect B)
\]
for all elements, $x$.

\begin{solution}
Two sets are equal iff they have the same elements, that is, $x$ is in
one set iff $x$ is in the other set, for any $x$.  We'll now prove this for $A$
and $(A-B) \union (A \intersect B)$.

\begin{align*}
\lefteqn{x \in (A-B) \union (A \intersect B)}\\
 & \qiff x \in (A-B) \QOR x \in (A
\intersect B) & \text{(by def of $\union$)}\\
& \qiff (x \in A \QAND \bar{x \in B})\\
& \qquad\qquad \QOR (x \in A \QAND  x \in B)
  & \text{(by def of $\intersect$ and $-$)}\\
& \qiff (P \QAND \bar{Q}) \QOR (P \QAND Q) & \text{(where $P \eqdef [x \in A]$ and $Q \eqdef [x \in B]$)}\\
& \qiff P & \text{(by part~\eqref{verprop})}\\
& \qiff x \in A & \text{(by def of $P$)}.
\end{align*}

\end{solution}

\begin{staffnotes}
Ask your students if they can now see how a computer could
automatically check such equalities between set formulas involving the
basic set operators like $\union, \intersect, -, \dots$?  The answer
is that proving such equalities reduces to verifying equivalence of
corresponding propositional formulas as above.
