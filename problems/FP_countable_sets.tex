\bparts

\ppart Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are countable sets, then so is $A
\union B$.

\begin{solution}

\begin{proof}
Suppose the list of distinct elements of $A$ is $a_0,a_1,\dots$ and the
list of $B$ is $b_0,b_1, \dots$.  Then a list of all the elements in $A
\union B$ is just
\begin{equation}\label{FP_a0b0list}
a_0,b_0,a_1,b_1, \dots a_n,b_n, \dots.
\end{equation}
Of course this list will contain duplicates if $A$ and $B$ have elements
in common, but then deleting all but the first occurrences of each element in
list~\eqref{FP_a0b0list} leaves a list of all the distinct elements of $A$
and $B$.
\end{proof}

\end{solution}
