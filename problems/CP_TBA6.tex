\begin{problem}
Write a program for a counter machine with two counters \texttt{R} and
\texttt{S} that adds 3 times the contents of \texttt{R} to the
contents of \texttt{S}, while setting the contents of \texttt{R} to 0.
That is, the machine simulates the assignment statements
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
\texttt{S :=} &\texttt{S + 3*R;}\\
\texttt{R :=} &\texttt{0}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Your program should only use the basic Counter Machine instructions
\texttt{T+} (increment counter \texttt{T}), \texttt{T-} (decrement
counter \texttt{T} unless it contains 0), \texttt{[T? $m$ $n$]} (if
\texttt{T} contains 0, goto line number $m$, otherwise goto to line
$n$) for any counter \texttt{T}.

\hint There is a five line program.
