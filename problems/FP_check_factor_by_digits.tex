\begin{problem}
Given any integer $x$ represented in base $b$, for some $k \in [2,b)$,
  we can check whether $x$ is a multiple of $k$ by checking whether
  the sum of the digits of $x$ is a multiple of $k$.  Let $K_b$ be all
  such $k$'s.  For example in decimal representation ($b = 10$), we
  can check whether any integer is a multiple of $3$ by checking
  whether the sum of the its digits is a multiple of $3$.

Let $x_{d-1}...x_1x_0$ be the representation of $x$ in base $b$,
where $d$ is the total number of digits.
Write an equation to express $x$ in terms of its digits.

\begin{solution}
$x = \sum_{i=0}^{d-1}{x_i}\left(b^i\right)$
\end{solution}

\ppart
Show that if $b \equiv 1 \mod k$,
then $x \equiv \sum_{i=0}^{d-1}{x_i} \mod k$.

\begin{solution}
$x \equiv \sum_{i=0}^{d-1}{x_i}\left(b^i\right)
\equiv \sum_{i=0}^{d-1}{x_i}\left(1^i\right)
\equiv \sum_{i=0}^{d-1}{x_i} \mod k$
\end{solution}

\ppart
Show that if $b \equiv 1 \mod k$,
then $k$ must be a divisor of $b-1$.
\begin{solution}
$b \equiv 1 \mod k$ implies $b-1 \equiv 0 \mod k$,
so $b-1$ is a multiple of $k$
\end{solution}

\ppart
For hexadecimal representation ($b = 16$), find $K_{16}$

\begin{solution}
$\set{3, 5, 15}$
\end{solution}
