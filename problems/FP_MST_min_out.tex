\begin{problem}
Let $G$ be a connected, weighted simple graph.  Let $v \vertices{G}$
be an arbitrary vertex whose incident edges have distinct weights.
Suppose that edge $\edge{v}{w} \in \edges{G}$ has minimum weight among
the edges incident to $v$.  Prove that $\edge{v}{w}$ must be an edge
of some\footnote{Actually, the minimum weight edge incident to $v$
  must be in \emph{every} MST, but you need not prove this.}  minumum
weight spanning tree (MST) of $G$.

\hint Appeal to the gray edge construction \inhandout{in the text}
\inbook{of Lemma~\bref{lem:edgeextends}}.  Alternatively, consider a
path in an MST from between $v$ and $u$.

\begin{solution}
Using the gray edge Lemma, color vertex $v$ black and all other
vertices white.  Then the only gray edges are the edges incident to
$v$, so $\edge{v}{w}$ will be the minimum weight gray edge, and
therefore will be in the MST built starting with this coloring.

Alternatively, if $\edge{v}{w}$ is not in some MST, $M$, then there is
a path in $M$ from $v$ to $u$, and this path must start with some edge
$g$ incident to $v$ that is heavier than $\edge{v}{w}$.  Then
$M-g+\edge{v}{w}$ would be an MST with smaller weight than $M$, a
contradiction.  So $\edge{v}{w}$ must be a member of every MST for $G$.
