\begin{problem}
Explain where the following proof goes wrong.

\emph{Theorem:} Every positive integer can be described in fewer than
fourteen words.

\begin{falseproof}
  Let $S$ be the set of all numbers that cannot be so described. It
  contains a least element.  This element is ``the smallest number that
  cannot be described in less than fourteen English words.''  But this is
  a thirteen-word description, a contradiction.  Thus $S$ must be empty,
  implying the theorem.
\end{falseproof}
