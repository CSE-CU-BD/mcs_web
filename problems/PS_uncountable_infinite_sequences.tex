\begin{problem}

  Let $[\naturals\to \set{1,2,3}]$ be the set of all
  sequences containing only the numbers 1, 2, and 3, for example,
\begin{align*}
(1, 1, 1, 1 ...),\\
(2, 2, 2, 2 ...),\\
(3, 2, 1, 3 ...).
\end{align*}
  For any sequence, $s$, let $s[m]$ be its $m$th element.

  Prove that $[\naturals \to \set{1,2,3}]$ is uncountable.

  \hint Suppose there was a list
\[
\mathcal{L} = \text{sequence}_0, \text{sequence}_1, \text{sequence}_2,
\dots
\]
of sequences in $[\naturals\to \set{1,2,3}]$ and show that there is a
``diagonal'' sequence $\text{diag} \in [\naturals \to \set{1,2,3}]$
that does not appear in the list.  Namely,
  \[
  \text{diag} \eqdef r(\text{sequence}_0[0]), r(\text{sequence}_1[1]),
  r(\text{sequence}_2[2]), \dots,
  \]
where $r:\set{1,2,3}\to \set{1,2,3}$ is some function such that $r(i)
\neq i$ for $i=1,2,3$.

\iffalse
  \hint Try to find a total injective relation from the power set
  $\power(A)$ to $A^{\naturals}$.
