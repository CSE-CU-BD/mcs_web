\begin{problem}
  There are four isomorphisms between these two graphs.  Describe as many
  as you can.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=3in]{figures/iso_graphs_morning.pdf}
\end{center}

\begin{solution}
These are the vertex correspondences for the four isomorphisms: \\
1A, 2B, 3C, 4D, 5E \\
1A, 2B, 3E, 4D, 5C \\
1B, 2A, 3C, 4D, 5E \\
1B, 2A, 3E, 4D, 5C
\end{solution}
