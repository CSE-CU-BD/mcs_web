\begin{problem}
  There are two isomorphisms between these two graphs.  Describe as many
  as you can.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=3in]{figures/iso_graphs_morning.pdf}
\end{center}

\begin{solution}
These are the vertex correspondences for the two isomorphisms: \\
1A, 2B, 3C, 4D, 5E \\
1D, 2C, 3B, 4A, 5E
\end{solution}
