\begin{problem}

You have a process for generating a positive integer, $K$, such that
$\prob{K = k} = \Theta(k^{-4})$.  The integer your process generates
is (mutually) independent of all the other integers it may generate.

You use your process to generate a random integer, and then use your
procedure repeatedly until you generate an integer as big as your
first one. 

\bparts

\ppart Let $p_k \eqdef \prob{K \geq k}$.  Show that $p_k =
\Theta(k^{-3})$.

\begin{solution}
Since $\prob{K = k} = \Theta(k^{-4})$, we have constants $a,b >0$ such
that
\[
ak^{-4} \leq \prob{K = k} \leq bk^{-4}
\]
for all $k \in \integers^+$.
So
\[
p_k = \sum_{m \geq k} \prob{K = m}
      \leq  \sum_{m \geq k} bm^{-4}
      \leq bk^{-4} + \int_k^\infty bx^{-4}\, dx < (b + (b/4))k^{-3},
\]
and similarly
\[
(a/4) \leq p_k
\]
which proves $p_k = \Theta(k^{-3})$.

\end{solution}

\ppart Let $R$ be the number of additional integers you have to
generate.  Show that $\expect{R}$ is infinite.

\begin{solution}
If $K=k$, then we can think of generating a number $\geq k$ as a
failure, so the expected number of repeats is the mean time to
failure.  Therefore,
\[
\expcond{R}{K=k} = \frac{1}{p_k} = \Theta(k^3).
\]
By Total Expectation,
\[
\expect{R} = \sum_{k \in \integers^+} \expcond{R}{K=k} \cdot \prob{K=k}
           = \sum_{k \in \integers^+} \Theta(k^{3}) \cdot \Theta{k^{-4}}
           = \sum_{k \in \integers^+} \Theta(k^{-1}) = \lim_{k \to
             \infty} H_k = \infty.
\]
\end{solution}
