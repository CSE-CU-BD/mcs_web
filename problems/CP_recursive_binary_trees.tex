\begin{problem}
  The set $\OBT$ of \emph{Ordered Binary Trees} is defined recursively
  as follows:

\inductioncase{Base case}: $\ang{\bleaf}$ is an $\OBT$, and

\inductioncase{Constructor case}: if $R$ and $S$ are $\OBT$'s, then
$\ang{\bnode,R,S}$ is an $\OBT$.

  The set $\LBT$ of \emph{Leaf-grown Binary Trees} is defined
  recursively as follows:

\inductioncase{Base case}: $\ang{\bleaf}$ is an $\LBT$, and

\inductioncase{Constructor case}: if $R$ is an $\LBT$, then the result
of replacing an occurrence of $\ang{\bleaf}$ in $R$ by
$\ang{\bnode,\leaf,\leaf}$ is an $\LBT$.

This problem will show that $OBT=LBT$.

\begin{staffnotes}
Need to define \emph{subtree} of an \OBT, and replacement of one
subtree by another.  What def of subtree?---maybe string in
$strings{\set{L,R}}$ describing root to leaf path to subtree?

\dots or define (recursively) a \emph{subtree} of $T$ to be an
``\OBT'' isomorphic to $T$ except where one occurrence of a
\bnode\ label is replaced by \dnode.

Then could recursively define \LBT as special case of \OBT\ with sole
\LBT\ constructor being replacement of a \bleaf\ subtree of an \LBT\  by
$\ang{\bnode,\bleaf,\bleaf}$.
