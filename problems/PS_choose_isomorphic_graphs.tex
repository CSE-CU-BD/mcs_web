\begin{problem}
Determine which among the four graphs pictured in the
Figures~\ref{fig:isog} are isomorphic.  If two of these graphs are
isomorphic, describe an isomorphism between them.  If they are not,
give a property that is preserved under isomorphism such that one
graph has the property, but the other does not.  For at least one of
the properties you choose, \emph{prove} that it is indeed preserved
under isomorphism (you only need prove one of them).

\begin{solution}
$G_1$ and $G_4$ are isomorphic.  In particular, the function
$f:V_1 \to V_3$ is an isomomorphism, where
\begin{align*}
&f(1)=1 \quad&& f(2)=2 \quad&& f(3)=3 \quad&& f(4)=8 \quad&& f(5)=9 \\
&f(6)=10 \quad&& f(7)=4 \quad&& f(8)=5 \quad&& f(9)=6 \quad&& f(10)=7
\end{align*}

$G_1$ and $G_2$ are not isomorphic to $G_3$: $G_3$ has a vertex of degree
four and neither $G_1$ nor $G_2$ has one.

$G_1$ and $G_2$ are not isomorphic: $G_2$ has a cycle of length
four and $G_1$ does not.

There are many examples of properties preserved under graph
isomorphism.  For example, we will prove that the degree of each
vertex is preserved under isomorphism.

Let $G$ and $H$ be isomorphic graphs. Since they are isomorphic, there
is an edge-preserving bijection between the vertices of $G$ and $H$:
\[
f(u) \in \vertices{H} \iff f(u) \in \vertices{G}
\]

We let the set of vertices adjacent to $u$ be $N(u)$. Because $f$ is
an edge-preserving bijection, there is an edge from $f(u)$ to a vertex
$f(k)$ iff $k \in N(u)$.  Thus $\card{N(f(u))} = \card{N(u)}$ and the
degree of each vertex is preserved under isomorphism.
\end{solution}
