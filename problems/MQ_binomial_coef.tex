$(x+x^2)^{6}$ can be expressed as $(x^6(1+x)^6$.\[\binom{6}{5} = 6\]\end{solution}\ppart $x^{10}y^5$ in $(19x+4y)^{15}$\begin{solution}\[\binom{17}{8}3^82^9.\]When $(19x+4y)^{15}$ is expressed as a sum of powers of the summands $19x$and $4y$, the coefficient of $(19x)^{10}(4y)^5$ is $\binom{15}{10}$, so thecoefficient of $x^{10}y^5$ is this binomial coefficient times $19^{10}\cdot 4^5$.\end{solution}\eparts\end{problem}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem ends here%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\endinput
