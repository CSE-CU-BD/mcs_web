\begin{problem}
Suppose there are two stable sets of marriages, a first set and a
second set.  So each man has a first wife and a second wife (they may
be the same), and likewise each woman has a first husband and a second
husband.  We will assume the following Lemma proved in
Problem~\bref{PS_stable_marriage_better_worse}:

\begin{lemma*}%\label{lem:better-worse}
A man does better in his second marriage iff his first wife does worse
in her second marriage.
\end{lemma*}

We can form a third set of marriages by matching each man with the
wife he prefers among his first and second wives.

\bparts

\ppart Prove that this third set of marriages is an exact matching: no
woman is married to two men.

\hint The Lemma.

\begin{solution}
\TBA{By Lemma.}
\end{solution}
