\begin{problem}
Suppose there are two stable sets of marriages, a first set and a
second set.  So each man has a first wife and a second wife, and
likewise each woman has a first husband and a second husband (they may
be the same).  Form a third set of marriages by matching each man with
the wife he likes better.

\bparts

\ppart Prove that this third set of marriages is an exact matching: no
woman is married to two men.

\hint Lemma~\bref{lem:better-worse}.

\begin{solution}
\TBA{By Lemma~\bref{lem:better-worse}.}
\end{solution}

\ppart Prove that this third set is stable.
