\begin{problem}
Show that in any set of 100 integers, there must be 15 such that the
difference of any 2 among the 15 is a multiple of 7.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Let the 100 integers be pigeons and the numbers $\Zintv{0}{6}$ be the
holes.  Map a pigeon to it remainder on division by 7.  By the
generalized pigeonhole principle, there must be $\ceil{100/7} = 15$
pigeons in one hole.  Since these 15 pigeons have the same remainder,
the difference of any two is divisible by 7.
\end{solution}
