\begin{problem}

Prove that the shortest odd-length closed walk through a vertex is an
odd-length cycle.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
As in the proof of Problem~\bref{PS_shortest_undirected_closed_walk}, if the
shortest odd-length closed walk contained a ``repeat'' vertex, then
the walk could be split at that vertex into two positive length closed
subwalks the sum of whose lengths was the length of the given shortest
walk.  But then exactly one of the two subwalks would be a shorter
odd-length walk, contradicting the minimality of the shortest
odd-length walk.
\end{proof}

\end{solution}
