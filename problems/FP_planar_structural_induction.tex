\begin{problem}  \textbf{Planar Embeddings}

The planar graph embeddings in class (repeated in the Appendix) were
only defined for connected planar graphs.  The definition can be
extended to planar graphs that are not necessarily connected by adding
the following additional constructor case to the definition:

%\fbox{\
%\begin{minipage}[t]{6.5in}
%\vspace{.1in}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Constructor Case:} (collect disjoint graphs) Suppose
  $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ are planar embeddings with no vertices in common.
  Then $\mathcal{E} \union \mathcal{F}$ is a planar embedding.
\end{itemize}
%\vspace{.1in}

%\end{minipage}}

%\examspace[0.1in]

Euler's Planar Graph Theorem now generalizes to unconnected graphs as
follows: if a planar embedding, $\mathcal{E}$, has $v$ vertices, $e$
edges, $f$ faces, and $c$ connected components, then
\begin{equation}\label{vef2c}
v-e+f-2c = 0.
\end{equation}
This can be proved by structural induction on the definition of planar
embedding.
