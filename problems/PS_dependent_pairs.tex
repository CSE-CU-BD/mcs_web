\begin{problem}
Let $R$, $S$, and $T$ be mutually independent indicator variables.

In general, the event that $S=T$ is not independent of $R=T$.  We can
explain this intuitively as follows: suppose that both $R$ and $T$ are
more likely to equal 1 than to equal 0, but $S$ is equally likely to
be 0 or 1, which implies that it is equally likely as not that $S=T$.
On the other hand, knowing that $R=S$ makes it more likely than not
that $S=1$, and knowing that $S=1$, makes it more likely than not that
$S=T$.  So knowing that $R=S$ makes it more likely than not that
$S=T$.

Now prove rigorously (without any appeal to intuition) that the
events $[R=S]$ and $[S=T]$ are independent iff either $R$ is
uniform\footnote{That is, $\pr{R=1} = 1/2$.}, or $T$ is uniform, or
$S$ is constant\footnote{That is, $\pr{S=1}$ is one or zero.}.

\begin{solution}
Let $r,s,t$ be the probabilities that $R=1, S=1, T=1$, respectively.
Then
\begin{align*}
\pr{R=S} & = rs + (1-r)(1-s)\\
\pr{S=T} & = st + (1-s)(1-t)\\
\pr{R=S \QAND S=T} & = rst + (1-r)(1-s)(1-t).
\end{align*}
So $[R=S]$ and $[S=T]$ are independent iff
\begin{equation}\label{rs+1-r.1-s}
[rs + (1-r)(1-s)][st + (1-s)(1-t)] = rst + (1-r)(1-s)(1-t).
\end{equation}
Subtracting the left from the right hand side of this equation and
factoring, we find that~\eqref{rs+1-r.1-s} holds iff
\[
s(s-1)(2r-1)(2t-1) = 0,
\]
namely, iff $s=0$ or $s=1$ or $r=1/2$ or $t=1/2$.  That is,
independence holds iff $S$ is constant or $R$ or $T$ is uniform.
\end{solution}
