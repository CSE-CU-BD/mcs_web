\begin{problem}
Let $R$, $S$, and $T$ be mutually independent random variables with
the same codomain, $V$.  Problem~\bref{PS_equal_birthdays} showed that
if  $R$ is uniform ---that is,
\[
\pr{R=b} = \frac{1}{\card{V}},
\]
for all $b \in V$, then
\begin{quote}
the events $[R=S]$ and $[S=T]$ are independent.
\end{quote}
This implies that these events are also independent if $T$ is uniform,
since $R$ and $T$ are symmetric in this assertion.  Prove converssely
that if neither $R$ nor $T$ is uniform, then these events are not
independent.

\begin{solution}
Let $r$ and $a$ respectively be the most and least likely values of
$R$; then $r \neq a$ since $R$ is not uniform.  Likewise, let $t \neq
b$ the most and least likely values of $T$.  By independence, $(r,t)$
is the most likely pair of values for $R$ and $T$, and $(a,b)$ the
least likely.
