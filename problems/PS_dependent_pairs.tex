\begin{problem}
Let $R$, $S$, and $T$ be mutually independent random variables with
the same codomain, $V$.  Problem~\bref{PS_equal_birthdays} showed that
if $R$ or $T$ is uniform ---that is,
\[
\pr{R=b} = \pr{T=b} =\frac{1}{\card{V}},
\]
for all $b \in V$, then
\begin{quote}
the events $[R=S]$ and $[S=T]$ are independent.
\end{quote}

Prove conversely that if neither $R$ nor $T$ is uniform, then
the events $[R=S]$ and $[S=T]$ are \emph{not} independent.

\begin{editingnotes}
This is trivially false if any of $R,S,T$ is constant.  And Requiring
them to be nonconstant, or more strongly that they take every possible
value with positive probabilty, still does not seem sufficient.
