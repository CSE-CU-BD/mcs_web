\begin{problem}
Let $G$ be a connected simple graph.  Prove that if an edge in a
connected graph is not traversed by any simple cycle, then it is a cut
edge.\footnote{A simple cycle is a subgraph of $G$ isomorphic to the
  cycle graph $C_n$ for $n \geq 3$.  An edge is a \term{cut-edge} when
  removing the edge disconnects the graph.}

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}

Supppose edge $\edge{u}{v}$ is not a cut-edge.  We show that it must
be traversed by a simple cycle.

Since the edge is not a cut-edge, the graph obtained by removing the
edge is connected.  So there exists a path from $u$ to $v$ which does
not traverse $\edge{u}{v}$.  We proved in lecture that the shortest
such path from $u$ to $v$ must be simple.  But this simple path
together with $\edge{u}{v}$ is a simple cycle that traverses
$\edge{u}{v}$.

\end{proof}
\end{solution}
