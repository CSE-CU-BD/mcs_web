\begin{problem}
A herd of cows is stricken by an outbreak of \emph{cold cow disease}.  The
disease lowers a cow's body temperature from normal levels, and the cow could die if its temperature goes below 90 degrees F.  The disease epidemic is so intense that it lowered the average temperature of the herd to $85$
degrees.  Body temperatures as low as $70$ degrees, \textbf{but no lower},
were actually found in the herd.

\bparts

\ppart\label{3/4cows} Use Markov's Bound\inbook{~\bref{markovthm}} to prove
that at most 75% of the cows may survive.

%\hint Let $T$ be the temperature of a random cow.

\examspace[2in]

\begin{solution}
Namely, let $T$ be the temperature of a random cow.

\iffalse

Applying Markov's Bound to $T$:
  \[
  \prob{T \geq 90} \leq \frac{\expect{T}}{90} = \frac{85}{90} =
  \frac{17}{18}\, .
  \]
  But $17/18 > 3/4$, so this bound is not good enough.
\fi

We apply Markov's Bound to $T-70$:
\[
\prob{T \geq 90} = \prob{T-70 \geq 20} \leq \frac{\expect{T-70}}{20} = (85-70)/20 = 3/4.
\]
\end{solution}


\ppart Suppose there are 400 cows in the herd.  Show that the bound of
part~\eqref{3/4cows} is the best possible by giving an example set of
temperatures for the cows so that the average herd temperature is 85
and 3/4 of the cows will have a high enough temperature to survive.

\begin{solution}
  Let 100 cows have temperature 70 degrees and 300 have 90 degrees.
  So 300/400 =3/4 of the cows have a survival temperature.  Also, the
  mean temperature is
\[
(1/4)70 + (3/4)90 = 85.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart Notice that the results above are purely arithmetic facts about
averages, not about probabilities.  But you verified the claim of
part~\eqref{3/4cows} by applying Markov's bound on the deviation of a
random variable.  Justify this approach by regarding the temperature,
$T$, of a cow as a random variable.  Carefully specify the probability
space on which $T$ is defined: what are the outcomes? what are their
probabilities?  Explain the precise connection between properties of $T$
and average herd temperature that justify application of Markov's Bound.

\begin{staffnotes}
  This is a simple but important conceptual point.  Make sure students
  explain it clearly---they have a tendency to gloss over it.
\end{staffnotes}

\begin{solution}
The sample space for $T$ is the set of cows in the herd, that is, each
cow is an outcome.  The probabilities are defined to be
\emph{uniform}---the probability of any cow, $c$, is $1/n$ where $n$
is the size of the herd---and $T(c)$ is the temperature of cow $c$.
Since the probabilities are uniform, it follows that

\begin{itemize}

\item the average temperature of the herd equals $\expect{T}$.

\item the fraction of cows with temperatures $\geq t$ is the
  probability that $T \geq t$.

\end{itemize}

So the fact that $\prob{T \geq 90} \leq 3/4$ implies that at most 3/4
of the herd could have survived.
