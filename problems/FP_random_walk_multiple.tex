\begin{problem} \mbox{}
A \term{trap} in a random walk digraph is a subgraph all of whose
edges end within the trap.  Circle whichever of the following
assertions are true of \idx{stable distributions} on random walk
graphs with exactly two traps:

\bparts

\ppart there may not be any

\ppart there may be a unique one

\ppart there may be exactly two

\ppart there are at most a finite number

\ppart there are at most a countably infinite number

\ppart there may be a uncountable number

\ppart there always is an uncountable number

\begin{solution}
The first five choices are false, and the last two are true.  That's a
stable distribution for the whole graph always consists of a stable
distribution of one trap weighted with total probability $r$ together
with a stable distribution of the other trap weighted with total
probability $1-r$, for any $r \in [0,1] \subseteq \reals$, and there
are an is uncountable number of real numbers in $[0,1]$.
\end{solution}
