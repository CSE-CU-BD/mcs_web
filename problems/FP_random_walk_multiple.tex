\begin{problem} \mbox{}
A \term{trap} in a random walk digraph is a subgraph all of whose
edges end within the trap.  Suppose a graph has exactly two traps and
they do not share any vertices.  Circle whichever of the following
assertions are true of \idx{stable distributions} the graph.

\bparts

%\ppart there may not be any

\ppart There may be a unique one.

%\ppart there may be exactly two

\ppart There are at most a finite number.

%\ppart there are at most a countably infinite number

\ppart There may be an uncountable number, but not necessarily.

\ppart There always is an uncountable number.

\begin{solution}
Only the last is true.  That's because a stable distribution for
the whole graph always consists of a stable distribution of one trap
weighted with total probability $r$ together with a stable
distribution of the other trap weighted with total probability $1-r$,
for any $r \in [0,1] \subseteq \reals$, and there are an is
uncountable number of real numbers in $[0,1]$.
\end{solution}
