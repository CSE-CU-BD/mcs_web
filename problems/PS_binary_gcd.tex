\begin{problem}
  The binary-GCD state machine computes the GCD of $a$ and $b$ using
  only division by 2 and subtraction, which makes it run very
  efficiently on hardware that uses binary representation of numbers.
  In practice, it runs more quickly than the more famous Euclidean
  algorithm described in Section~\bref{sec: Euclid}.

\begin{align*}
\text{states} & \eqdef \naturals^3\\
\text{start state} & \eqdef (a, b, 1)
             & \text{(where $a > b >0$)}\\
\text{transitions} & \eqdef \text{ if } \min(x,y) > 0, \text{ then } (x,  y, e) \movesto\\
     &\qquad \text{the first possible state according to the rules:}\\
     &\qquad
       \begin{cases}
       (1, 0, ex)     & \text{(if $x = y$)}\\
       (1, 0, e)      & \text{(if $y=1$)},\\
       (x/2, y/2, 2e) & \text{(if $2 \divides x$ and $2 \divides y$)},\\
       (y, x, e)      & \text{(if $y>x$)}\\
       (x, y/2, e)    & \text{(if $2 \divides y$)}\\
       (x/2, y, e)    & \text{(if $2 \divides x$)}\\
       (x-y,y,e)      & \text{(otherwise)}.
       \end{cases}
\end{align*}

\ppart Prove that if this machine stops, that is, reaches a state
$(x,y,e)$ in which no transition is possible, then $e = \gcd(a,b)$.

\begin{solution}
Invariant is $\gcd(a,b) = e\gcd(x,y)$.  To show this, we assume the invariant holds for state $(x,y,e)$
and show that if $(x,y,e) \movesto (x',y',e')$, then $\gcd(a,b) = e'\gcd(x',y')$.

The proof is by cases according to which kind of transition occurs.

\inductioncase{Case}: ($x=y$).  in this case we have $\gcd(x,y) = x$
so by the invariant, $\gcd(a,b) = ex$.  So $e'\gcd(x',y') =
ex\gcd(1,0) = ex = \gcd(a,b)$, which shows that the invariant holds
for $(x',y',e')$.

\inductioncase{Case}: $2 \divides x$ and $2 \divides y$.  We use the
fact that $\gcd(ax,ay) = a\gcd(x,y)$.

$3+2\log \max(a,b)$ transitions.
