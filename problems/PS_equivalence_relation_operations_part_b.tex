\begin{problem}

Let $R_1$ and $R_2$ be two equivalence relations on a set of integers, $A$. Prove that $R_1 \cup R_2$ is NOT an equivalence relation. Remember that an equivalence relation must be reflexive, transitive, and symmetric.

\begin{solution}
We give a counterexample showing that $R_1 \cup R_2$ may not be
an equivalence relation.  Let $R_1$ and $R_2$ be the relations on
$\set{1, 2, 3}$ where
\begin{align*}
R_1 \eqdef & \set{(1,1) (2,2) (3,3) (1,2) (2,1)},\\
R_2 \eqdef & \set{(1,1) (2,2) (3,3) (2,3) (3,2)}.
\end{align*}
It's easy to check that $R_1$ and $R_2$ are both equivalence relations.
But $R_1\cup R_2$ is not transitive, because $(1,2),(2,3) \in R_1\cup R_2$
and $(1,3) \notin R_1\cup R_2$.  Therefore $R_1\cup R_2$ is not an
equivalence relation.

\vspace{5mm}
We can also write a proof instead of providing a counterexample. Specifically, we can conclude that transitivity (if $a$ $R$ $b$ and $b$ $R$ $c$ then $a$ $R$ $c$) can be violated when $(a, b)$ belongs only to $R_1$ and $(b, c)$ belongs only to $R_2$. Then, it is not necessarily true that $a$ $R$ $c$.
