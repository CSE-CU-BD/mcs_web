\begin{problem}
Truth values for propositional variables $P,Q,R$ are chosen
independently, with
\[
\pr{P=\true} = 1/2,\ \pr{Q=\true} = 1/3,\ \pr{R=\true} = 1/5.
\]
What is the probability that the formula
\insolutions{\begin{equation}\label{PpQR}}
\instatements{\[}
(P \QIMPLIES Q) \QIMPLIES R
\instatements{\]}
\insolutions{\end{equation}}

\examspace[3in]

\begin{solution}
Consider the separate cases in which~\eqref{pPQR} is true:

\inductioncase{$R = \true$}: This case happens with probability $1/5$.

\inductioncase{$R = \false \QAND Q = \false \QAND P = \true$}: This case
happens with probability $(4/5)(2/3)(1/2)$.

So the probability~\eqref{PpQR} is true is
\[
\frac{1}{5}+\frac{4}{5}\frac{2}{3}\frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{15}.
\]

Another breakdown into cases is $P =\true \QAND Q=\false$, and
$\QNOT(P =\true \QAND Q=\false) \QAND R = \true$ with probability
\[
\frac{1}{2}\frac{2}{3} + (1- \frac{1}{2}\frac{2}{3})\frac{1}{5} = \frac{7}{15}
\]
\end{solution}
