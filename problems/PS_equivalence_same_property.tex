\begin{problem}
For any total function $f:A \to B$ define a relation $\equiv_f$ by the rule:
\begin{equation}\label{equivf}
a \equiv_f a' \qiff f(a) = f(a').
\end{equation}

\bparts

 \ppart Prove that $\equiv_f$ is an equivalence relation on $A$.

\begin{solution}
Reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of $\equiv_f$ follow
immediately from the reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of the
equality relation.
\end{solution}

 \ppart Prove that every equivalence relation on a set $A$ is equal to
 $\equiv_f$ for some total function $f:A \to B$.

\begin{solution}
If $R$ is an equivalence relation on $A$, let $B$ be the set
$\set{[a]_R \suchthat a \in A}$ of blocks of the partition of $A$
defined by $R$.  Define $f(a) \eqdef [a]_R$.
\end{solution}
