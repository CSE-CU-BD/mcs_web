\begin{problem}
Let's say that digraph $G$ has the \emph{unique path property} when,
for any nonempty, finite set of vertices of $G$, there is a unique
directed path going through exactly these vertices.

\bparts

\ppart Prove that if $G$ has the unique path property, then $G$ is a
linear partial order.

\begin{solution}
\TBA{}
\end{solution}

\ppart Prove conversely that if $G$ is a linear partial order, then
$G$ has the unique path property.

\begin{solution}
\TBA{by induction on size of finite set?}
\end{solution}
