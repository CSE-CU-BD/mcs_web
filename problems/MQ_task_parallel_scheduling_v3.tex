\begin{problem}
Let $\{A, ..., H\}$ be a set of tasks that we must complete. The following DAG describes which tasks must be done before others, where there is an arrow from $a$ to $b$ iff $a$ must be done before $b$.

\ppart
What is the largest chain in this DAG, if there is more than one, only show one.
\begin{solution}
A, D, E, G
\end{solution}

\ppart
What is the largest antichain? (again, pick one if you find there is more than one).
\begin{solution}
A, B, C or D, B, C
\end{solution}
\examspace[3cm]

\ppart
If each task takes 1 minute to complete, what is the minimum amount of time needed to complete all the tasks with a single processor?
\begin{solution}
8 minutes
\end{solution}
\examspace[3cm]

\ppart
If we allow parallel scheduling, and each task takes 1 minute to complete, what is the minimum amount of time needed to complete all the tasks with unlimited processors?
\begin{solution}
This should be the length of the longest chain, 4 minutes.
\end{solution}
