\begin{problem}
The following DAG describes the prerequisites among tasks $\set{A,
  \dots, H}$.

\iffalse

\ppart
What is the largest chain in this DAG?
\begin{solution}
$A, D, E, G$
\end{solution}
\examspace[2cm]
\fi

\ppart
What are the two maximum size antichains?
\begin{solution}
$A, B, C$ or $D, B, C$
\end{solution}
\examspace[2cm]

\iffalse
\ppart If each task takes 1 minute to complete, what is the
minimum amount of time needed to complete all the tasks with a single
processor?
\begin{solution}
8 minutes
\end{solution}
\examspace[3cm]
\fi

\ppart If each task takes unit time to complete, what is the minimum
parallel time to complete all the tasks?

\begin{solution}
This is the size of the maximum chain, namely, 4.
\end{solution}

\examspace[2cm]

\ppart What is the minimum parallel time if no more than two tasks can
be completed in parallel?

\begin{solution}
Still 4: schedule $A,B$ then $C,D$ then $E,F$ then $G,H$.
\end{solution}
