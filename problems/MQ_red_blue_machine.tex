\begin{problem}
There is a bucket with an equal number of red and blue balls.  Balls
will be added and removed from the bucket according to the following
two rules:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] Remove an equal number of red and blue balls.

\item[(ii)] If the bucket has at least as many blue balls as red
  balls, then add red balls so the number of red balls doubles.
\end{enumerate}

\bparts

\ppart Starting with 10 reds and 10 blues, show how any red and blue
balls are in the bucket during five successive applications of these
rules, using each of the rules at least once.

\examspace[1.0in]

\ppart
Let $b$ be the number of blue balls and $r$ the number of red balls in the bucket.
Prove that $2b-r \ge 0$ is a preserved invariant under application of these rules.

\examspace[2.0in]

\ppart What property of the derived variable $2b-r$ guarantees that
this process must terminate?  That is, the bucket must eventually
contain a number of red and blue balls to which neither of the abive
rules applies, no matter what the equal number of red and blue balls
was initially.  Prove that $2b-r$ has this property.

\examspace[3.0in]

\begin{solution}
$2b-r$ is strictly decreasing and bounded below (by minus the initial
  number of red balls), which guarantees termination.

To verify strictly decreasing \textbf{TBA}
