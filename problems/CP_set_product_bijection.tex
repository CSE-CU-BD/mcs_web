\begin{problem}
Let $A = \set{a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{n-1}}$ be a set of size $n$, and $B =
\set{b_0,b_1,\dots,b_{m-1}}$ a set of size $m$.  Prove that $\card{A
  \times B} = mn$ by defining a simple bijection from $A \times B$ to
the nonnegative integers from $0$ to $mn-1$.

\begin{staffnotes}
Point out the Computer Science connection: this is how a compiler
computes locations in memory of a 2D-array.  It also indicates why
most programming languages require the programmer to specify the array
dimmensions in advance.
\end{staffnotes}

\begin{solution}
Let $[0,mn) \eqdef \set{0,1,\dots,mn-1}$.

A bijection $f:A \times B \to [0,mn)$ can be defined by the rule
\[
f(a_j,b_k) \eqdef jm + k.
\]

To verify that $f$ is a bijection, note that $f$ is a total function
with domain $A \times B$ by definition.  

The range of $f$ is a subset of $[0,mn)$ because for $0
\leq j \leq n-1$ and $0 \leq k \leq m-1$
\[
0 \leq jm + k \leq (n-1)m + m-1 = mn-1.
\]

Finally, $f$ is a surjection and an injection because every element of
$i \in [0,mn)$ is $f(a_j,b_k)$ for a unique pair $(j,k)$, namely, the
  $j$ is the quotient and $K$ is the remainder of $i$ divided by $m$.
