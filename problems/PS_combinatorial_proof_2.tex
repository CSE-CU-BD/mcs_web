\begin{problem}
Give a combinatorial proof for this identity:
\[
\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{k+i}{k} = \binom{k+n+1}{k+1}
\]

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
Let $S$ be the set of all binary sequences with exactly $n$ zeroes and
$k + 1$ ones.

On the one hand, we know from that the number of
such sequences is equal to $\binom{k + n + 1}{k+1}$.

On the other hand, the number, $i$, of zeroes to the left of the
rightmost one ranges from 0 to $n$.  For a fixed value of $i$, there
are $\binom{k + i}{k}$ possible choices for the sequence of bits
before the rightmost one.  If we sum over all possible $i$, we find
that $\card{S} = \sum_{i = 0}^n \binom{k + i}{k}$.

Equating these two expressions for $\card{S}$ proves the theorem.
\end{proof}
