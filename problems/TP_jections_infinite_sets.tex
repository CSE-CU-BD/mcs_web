\ppart Let $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to C$ be functions. In PSet 3, we have seen that if the composition $g \compose f$ is a bijection,
then $f$ is a total injection and $g$ is a surjection.

Suppose that we relax $g$ to be an arbitrary relation $G$. Show an 
example demonstrating that $f$ need not be a surjection, and $G$ need not be
total, or even a function.

\begin{solution}

\begin{proof}

Assume $g$ to be a more general relation $G$ consisting of a bunch of arrows between $B$ and $C$.

A simple way to construct the example is to make $B$ somewhat ``larger'' than $A$ in the
following way. Let $B$ have an element not in the range of $f$ with no $G$-arrow out. 
Therefore, $g$ is not total. Moreover, $f$ is not a surjection.

Further, let another element in $B$ not in the range of
$f$ have {\em two} $G$-arrows out. Therefore $g$ is not a function.

Basically, this example demonstrates that for $g \compose f$ to be a bijection, all that matters is that $g$
behaves ``nicely'' over the range of $f$.

\end{solution}


\ppart Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are countable sets, then so is $A
\union B$.

\begin{solution}

\begin{proof}
Suppose we list the elements of $A$ as $a_0,a_1,\dots$ and the
elements of $B$ as $b_0,b_1, \dots$.  Then a list of all the elements in $A
\union B$ can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{FP_a0b0list}
a_0,b_0,a_1,b_1, \dots a_n,b_n, \dots.
\end{equation}
Of course, this list can potentially contain duplicates if $A$ and $B$ have elements
in common, but then deleting all but the first occurrences of each element in
list~\eqref{FP_a0b0list} leaves a list of all the {\em distinct} elements of
$A$ and $B$, which is the same as the list of elements in
$A \union B$.
