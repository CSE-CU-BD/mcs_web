\begin{problem}
I have twelve cards:
%
\[
\fbox{1}\ \fbox{1}\quad \fbox{2}\ \fbox{2}\quad \fbox{3}\ \fbox{3}\quad
\fbox{4}\ \fbox{4}\quad \fbox{5}\ \fbox{5}\quad \fbox{6}\ \fbox{6}
\]
%
I shuffle them and deal them in a row.  For example, I might get:
%
\[
\fbox{1}\ \fbox{2}\ \fbox{3}\ \fbox{3}\ \fbox{4}\ \fbox{6}\ 
\fbox{1}\ \fbox{4}\ \fbox{5}\ \fbox{5}\ \fbox{2}\ \fbox{6}
\]
%
What is the expected number of adjacent pairs with the same value?  In
the example, there are two adjacent pairs with the same value, the 3's
and the 5's.

\begin{solution}
Consider an adjacent pair.  The left card matches only one
of the other 11 cards, which is equally likely to be in any of the 11
other positions.  Therefore, the probability that an adjacent pair
matches is $1/11$.  Since there are 11 adjacent pairs, the expected
number of matches is $11 \cdot 1/11 = 1$ by linearity of expectation.
\end{solution}
