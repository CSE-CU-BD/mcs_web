\begin{problem}

\inhandout{A set of numbers is \term{well ordered} when each of its nonempty
subsets has a minimum element.  The Well Ordering principle says, of
course, that the set of nonnegative integers is well ordered, but so
are lots of other sets, for example, the set $r\naturals$ of numbers
of the form $rn$, where $r$ is a positive real number and $n \in
\naturals$.}

Indicate which of the following sets of numbers have a minimum element
and which are well ordered.  For those that are not well ordered, give
an example of a subset with no minimum element.
     
\bparts
    
\ppart\label{geqsqrt2} The integers $\geq - \sqrt{2}$.

\begin{solution}
These have a minimum element -1, and are well ordered by
Corollary~\bref{lower_bound_cor}.
\end{solution}

\iffalse

\ppart The integers $> \sqrt{2}$.

\begin{solution}
\dots same as part~\eqref{geqsqrt2}.
\end{solution}
\fi

\ppart The rational numbers $\geq \sqrt{2}$.

\begin{solution}
These have no minimum element and so are not well ordered.

They have no minimum element because $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational
(Theorem~\bref{thm:sqrt2irr_by_contra}).  So if $r$ is rational number
$\geq \sqrt{2}$, then in fact $r > \sqrt{2}$.  This means that $r$ is
not a minimum element $\geq \sqrt{2}$ because the open-ended real
interval $(\sqrt{2},r)$ has positive length, and therefore contains a
rational number, $q$, which is less than $r$ and greater than
$\sqrt{2}$.
\end{solution}

\ppart The set of rationals of the form $1/n$ where $n$ is a
positive integer.

\begin{solution}
No minimum element.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{fin-below} A set, $R$, of real numbers with the property
that every element of $R$ has only finitely many elements of $R$ below
it.  All the sets $r\naturals$ for real $r>0$ have this property.

\hint You may assume that every finite set of real numbers has a
minimum element.  (If you feel this assumption requires a proof, see
Problem~\bref{TP_min_of_finite}).

\iffalse
See Problem~\bref{CP_well_order_decreasing}.

\begin{staffnotes}
This is a point where students may get lost in unfamiliar reasoning
about abstract properties.  If they are stuck, give them $S_{\leq r}$
and have them verify that $\min S_{\leq r} = \min S$.
\end{staffnotes}

\begin{solution}
To show that $R$ is well ordered, let $S$ be a nonempty subset of $R$,
and suppose $r \in S$.  We claim $S$ has a minimum element.  To see
why, let $S_{\leq r}$ be the set of elements in $S$ that are less than
or equal to $r$.  A minimum number in $S_{\leq r}$ is obviously also a
minimum number in $S$.\footnote{Some things really are too obvious to
  belabor with a proof ---we're not trying to intimidate you into
  accepting something doubtful.}  But $S_{\leq r}$ is finite by
hypothesis, and therefore has a minimum element.
\end{solution}

\iffalse

\ppart The set of rationals of the form $1/n$ where $n$ is a positive
integer less than or equal to a $g \eqdef 10^{100}$ (a \term{google}).

\begin{solution}
This is a finite set of size a google, and so is well ordered.  Its
minimum element $1/g$.
\end{solution}
\fi

\ppart The set $G$ of rationals of the form $m/n$ where $m$ and $n$
are positive integers and $n \leq g \eqdef 10^{100}$ (a \term{google}).

\begin{staffnotes}
Suggesting quotients and remainders on division by $g$ might be a good
hint if students are stuck.
\end{staffnotes}

\begin{solution}
$G$ has minimum element $1/g$.  Furthermore, there are only finitely
  many numbers in $G$ that are less than any given real number, $r$,
  so $G$ is well ordered by part~\eqref{fin-below}.

To see why there are only finitely many elements in $G$ below any
element of $G$, note that every number in $G$ can be written as its
quotient, $q$, on division by $g$ plus a remainder of at most $g$.  So
there are at $qg$ numbers in $G$ that are less than a given element of
$G$.
\end{solution}

\iffalse %subsumed by text

\ppart The set $H$ of rational numbers of the form $n/(n+1)$ where $n$
is a nonnegative integer.

\begin{staffnotes}
Asking for a count of how many elements in $H$ are
  less than the element $n/(n+1)$ ---namely $n$ ---might be a good
  hint for stuck students
\end{staffnotes}

\begin{solution}
$H$ has minimum element 0.  Since there are only $n$ elements in $H$
  less than the element $n/(n+1) \in H$, the set $H$ is well ordered by
  part~\eqref{fin-below}.
\end{solution}

\ppart The set $J \eqdef H \union \set{1}$.

Explain why $J$ does not satisfy the finiteness condition of
part~\eqref{fin-below}.)

\begin{solution}
$J$ has minimum element 0 and is well ordered.

To verify well ordering, let $S$ be any nonempty subset of $J$.  If
$S$ contains a number in $H$, then the minimum number in $S$ is the
minimum number in $S \intersect H$, which has a minimum element since
$H$ is well ordered.  If $S$ contains no number in $H$, then the
integer 1 must be its only, and therefore minimum, element.

$J$ does not satisfy the finiteness condition of
part~\eqref{fin-below} because the infinitely many numbers in $H$ are
all less than 1.
\end{solution}

\ppart The set
\[
\naturals + H \eqdef \set{n + h \suchthat n \in \naturals \QAND h \in H}.
\]

\begin{solution}
$\naturals + H$ has minimum element 0.  It is also well ordered: to
  find the minimum of any nonempty subset $S$, let $n_S \in \naturals$
  be the least nonnegative integer in $\set{\floor{s} \suchthat s \in
    S}$\footnote{$\floor{r}$ is the greatest integer $\leq r$.}  Such
  an $n_S$ exists by the Well Ordering Principle.  Then let $h_S \in
  H$ be the least element of $H$ in $\set{h \in H \suchthat n_S+h \in
    S}$.  Such an $h_S$ exists since $H$ is well ordered.  Now it's
  easy to verify that $n_S+h_S$ is the minimum element of $S$.
