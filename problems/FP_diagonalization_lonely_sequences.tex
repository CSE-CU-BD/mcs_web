\begin{problem}
  Let $\binw$ be the set of infinite binary sequences. Call a sequence in $\binw$ \emph{lonely} if it never has two~1s in a row. For example, the repeating sequence $$(0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,\ldots)$$ is lonely, but the sequence $$(0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,\ldots)$$ is not lonely because it has two $1$s next to each other. If $F$ is the set of lonely sequences, show that $F$ is uncountable.

  \hint Consider a diagonal argument like those done in class.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
 
  \begin{proof}
    We'll argue by diagonalization with ``slope -1/2'' as we saw in class. For the sake of contradiction, assume $F$ is countable. Since $F$ is certainly infinite, it must be in bijection with $\mathbb{N}$, so we can write $F = \{s_0, s_1, s_2, \ldots\}$. Define a new sequence $t\in\binw$ as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
      t \eqdef (\bar{s_0[0]}, 0, \bar{s_1[2]}, 0, \bar{s_2[4]}, 0, \ldots).
    \end{equation*}
    In detail, for each $k\in\mathbb{N}$, we define $t[2k]$ as the opposite of bit $s_k[2k]$, and $t[2k+1]$ is always $0$. Because $1$s can only appear at even indices, $t$ is lonely, so $t\in F$. On the other hand, $t\ne s_k$ for $k\in\mathbb{N}$, because $t$ and $s_k$ differ in their $2k$th digit. Thus, $t\notin\{s_0,s_1,s_2,\ldots\}$, i.e., $t\notin F$. This is a contradiction, so our assumption that $F$ is countable must be false, i.e., $F$ is uncountable.
  \end{proof}

  A similar, alternate proof does not rely on diagonalization at all.

  \begin{proof}
    We'll show that $\binw\inj F$, which suffices because  we already know that $\binw$ is uncountable. Define the function $g: \binw\to F$ as follows: for a sequence $s\in\binw$, $g(s)$ is the sequence
    \begin{equation*}
      (s[0], 0, s[1], 0, s[2], 0, \ldots).
    \end{equation*}
    The sequence $g(s)$ contains no adjacent $1$s, so $g(s)\in F$. We can see that $g$ is total by definition. Furthermore, $g$ is injective, because if $s,t\subset\binw$ are different sequences, then $s[k]\ne t[k]$ for some $k\in\mathbb{N}$, and then $g(s)$ and $g(t)$ will differ in the $2k$th digit. So $g$ is a total injective relation, meaning $\binw \inj F$, as required.
  \end{proof}
\end{solution}
