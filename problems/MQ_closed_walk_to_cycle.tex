\begin{problem}
 
Draw a simple graph that has two vertices $u \neq v$ and two distinct paths between $u$ and $v$, but no cycle that includes both $u$ and $v$. Be sure to label $u$ and $v$ on your drawing.

\hint There is an example with 4 vertices.

\examspace[2in]
\begin{solution}
One possibility is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:closed_walk_graph}.  Here, $uabv$ and $ubv$ are two paths from $u$ and $v$.  (Since v has degree $1$ it cannot be part of a cycle.)
