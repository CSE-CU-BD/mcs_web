\begin{problem} 
Draw a simple graph in which there are at least two distinct paths between two of the graph's vertices, $u$ and $v$, but no cycle that includes both $u$ and $v$. Be sure to label $u$ and $v$ on your drawing.

\hint There is a four-vertex graph that exhibits this property.

\examspace[2in]
\begin{solution}
One possibility is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:closed_walk_graph}.  Here, $uabv$ and $ubv$ are two paths between $u$ and $v$.  Since $v$ has degree $1$, it cannot be part of a cycle, though it can be (and is) part of a 
positive-length closed walk.
