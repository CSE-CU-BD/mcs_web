\problempart
Draw a simple graph that has two vertices $u \neq
v$ and two distinct paths between $u$ and $v$, but no cycle including
either $u$ or $v$. Be sure to label $u$ and $v$ on your drawing.

\hint There is an example with 4 vertices.

\examspace[2in]
\begin{solution}
One possibility is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:closed_walk_graph}.  Here, a closed walk that includes $u$ and $v$ is $uabcvbu$.  (This closed walk in particular is not a cycle because it is not a path: the vertex $b$ appears twice.)
