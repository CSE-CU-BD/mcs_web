\begin{problem} 
  A binary relation, $R$, on a set, $A$, is \emph{irreflexive} iff
  $\QNOT(a \mrel{R} a)$ for all $a \in A$.  Prove that if a binary
  relation on a set is transitive and irreflexive, then it is strict
  partial order.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}

Suppose $R$ transitive and irreflexive.  Since it is transitive, to
check that it is a strict partial order, we need only verify that it
is asymmetric.

To prove that it is asymmetric, suppose $a\mrel{R}b$ holds for some
$a,b\in A$.  We need to prove $\QNOT(b \mrel{R} a)$.

So assume to the contrary that $b\mrel{R}a$ holds.  Then $a\mrel{R}b$
and $b\mrel{R}a$, so by transitivity, $a\mrel{R}a$, contradicting the
fact that $R$ is irreflexive.  So $b\mrel{R}a$ does not hold, as
claimed.
\end{proof}
\end{solution}
