\begin{problem}
According to the Multinomial theorem, $(w+x+y+z)^n$ can be expressed as a
sum of terms of the form
\[
\binom{n}{r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4}w^{r_1}x^{r_2}y^{r_3}z^{r_4}.
\]
How many terms are there in the sum?

\begin{solution}
The sum is over all 4-tuples of nonnegative integers
$(r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4)$ such that
\[
r_1+r_2+r_3+r_4 = n.
\]
We know this is the same as the number of binary words with $n$ zeroes and
3 ones, namely
\[
\binom{n+3}{3}.
\]
\end{solution}
