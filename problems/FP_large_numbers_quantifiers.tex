\begin{problem}
Let $G_1, G_2, G_3, \dots, $ be an infinite sequence of pairwise
independent random variables with the same expectation, $\mu$, and the
same finite variance.  Let
\[
f(n, \epsilon) \eqdef \Prob{\, \abs{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n G_i}{n} - \mu} \leq \epsilon}.
\]
The Weak Law of Large Numbers can be expressed as a logical formula of
the form:
\[
\forall \epsilon > 0\,Q_1\,Q_2\dots\, [f(n,\epsilon) \geq 1 - \delta]
\]
where $Q_1Q_2\dots$ is a sequence of quantifiers from among:
\[\begin{array}{cccccc}
\forall n & \exists n & \forall n_0 & \exists n_0 & \forall n \geq
n_0 & \exists n \geq n_0\\
&\forall \delta > 0 & \exists \delta >0 & \forall \delta \geq 0
                   & \exists \delta \geq 0
\end{array}\]
Here the $n$ and $n_0$ range over nonnegative integers, and $\delta$ and
$\epsilon$ range over real numbers.

Write out the proper sequence $Q_1Q_2\dots$ 
\begin{center}
\exambox{04in}{0.75in}{-0.2in}
\end{center}

\begin{solution}
\[
\forall \epsilon > 0. \, \forall \delta > 0.\, \exists n_0.\, \forall n
\geq n_0.
\]
\end{solution}
