\begin{problem}
  Let A and B denote two countably infinite sets:
  \[ A=\left\{a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots\right\} \]
  \[ B=\left\{b_0,b_1,b_2,b_3,\ldots\right\} \]
  Show that their product, $A\times B$, is also a countable set 
  by showing that it is possible to list the elements of $A\times B$.\\\\
  You only need to show the first six elements of this (infinitely long) list,
  as long as the underlying pattern is clear.\\\\
  Recall that the set product $S_1\times S_2\times\cdots\times S_n$ is just
  the set of all possible sequences of length $n$ whose $i$th element
  is drawn from $S_i$.  In particular, $A\times B$ is the set of all possible ordered 
  pairs $(a_i,b_j)$, $i=0,1,2,\ldots$, $j=0,1,2,\ldots$. 

\begin{solution}
    The elements of $A\times B$ can be arranged as follows:
  \[\begin{array}{ccccc}
	{\color{Red}(a_0,b_0)} & {\color{Blue}(a_0,b_1)} & {\color{Green}(a_0,b_2)} & {\color{Magenta}(a_0,b_3)} & \dots\\
	{\color{Blue}(a_1,b_0)} & {\color{Green}(a_1,b_1)} & {\color{Magenta}(a_1,b_2)} & {\color{MidnightBlue}(a_1,b_3)} & \dots\\
	{\color{Green}(a_2,b_0)} & {\color{Magenta}(a_2,b_1)} & {\color{MidnightBlue}(a_2,b_2)} & {\color{OliveGreen}(a_2,b_3)} & \dots\\
	{\color{Magenta}(a_3,b_0)} & {\color{MidnightBlue}(a_3,b_1)} & {\color{OliveGreen}(a_3,b_2)} & {\color{Fuchsia}(a_3,b_3)} & \dots\\
	\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
  \end{array}\]
  Traversing this grid along successive lower-left to upper-right diagonals yields the required list:
  \[{\color{Red}(a_0,b_0)},{\color{Blue}(a_1,b_0)},{\color{Blue}(a_0,b_1)},{\color{Green}(a_2,b_0)},{\color{Green}(a_1,b_1)},{\color{Green}(a_0,b_2)},{\color{Magenta}(a_3,b_0)},{\color{Magenta}(a_2,b_1)},{\color{Magenta}(a_1,b_2)},{\color{Magenta}(a_0,b_3)},\ldots\]
  Obviously, travelling in the opposite direction along each diagonal yields an equally acceptable list:
  \[{\color{Red}(a_0,b_0)},{\color{Blue}(a_0,b_1)},{\color{Blue}(a_1,b_0)},{\color{Green}(a_0,b_2)},{\color{Green}(a_1,b_1)},{\color{Green}(a_2,b_0)},{\color{Magenta}(a_0,b_3)},{\color{Magenta}(a_1,b_2)},{\color{Magenta}(a_2,b_1)},{\color{Magenta}(a_3,b_0)},\ldots\]
\end{solution}
