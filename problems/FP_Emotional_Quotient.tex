There is a newly developed test called EQ \textit{(Emotional Quotient)}, that is used to decide whether or not you will be able to make friends outside MIT. $EQ$ is expressed as nonnegative integer. The average EQ over all humans is 108.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Knowing only the average $EQ$, find an upper bound for the fraction of humans that have $EQ\ge1500$

\textbf{sol:} We can use the Markov's inequality to obtain the upper bound.

$$Pr\{X\geq cE[X]\} \leq \frac1c$$

setting $c=1500/1000=3/2$, we obtain the upper bound 2/3.
 
\item Assuming that the standard deviation of $EQ$ is 100, what fraction of humans can have $EQ\geq 1500$

\textbf{sol:} We use the Chebychev's inequality 
$$Pr\{X\geq E[X]  + c\sigma_x\}\leq \frac1{1+c^2}$$
 with $c=5$ to get an upper bound of $\frac1{26}$

\end{enumerate}
