\begin{problem}
A sequence of vertices of a graph has \index{graph!width}\emph{width}
$w$ iff each vertex is adjacent to at most $w$ vertices that precede
it in the sequence.  A simple graph, $G$, had width $w$ if
there is a width-$w$ sequence of all its vertices.

\ppart\label{widthmindeg}  Explain why the width of a graph must obviously be at least the
minimum degree of its vertices.

\begin{solution}
However the vertices are lined up in sequence, the last vertex in the
list will be preceded by all the vertices adjacent to it, so the width
will be at least the degree of the last vertex.
\end{solution}

\ppart Prove that if a finite graph has width $w$, then there is a
width-$w$ sequence of all it vertices that ends with a minimum degree
vertex.

\begin{solution}
Removing a vertex from a width-$w$ sequence leaves a width-$w$
sequence, and adding a new vertex of degree $d$ to the end of a
width-$w$ sequence yields a width-$\max(w,d)$ sequence.

So if a sequence of all the vertices of a graph has width $w$, then,
since $w$ is at least the minimum degree, moving a minimum degree
vertex to the end of the list will yield another width-$w$ sequence of
all the vertices.
\end{solution}

\ppart Describe a simple algorithm to find the minimum width a graph.

\begin{solution}
\TBA{Work out nonrecursive version}

Recursive ``greedy'' is easy: remove any min degree vertex, create min
width sequence for remaining subgraph, put back min degree.

This implies that there is a min-width sequences in which vertex
degrees are weakly decreasing.  So nonrecursive greedy can start
sequence with max degree vertex.  So if there is a unique max-degree
vertex, it can come first in min-width sequence.  But if more than one
max-degree, I don't think every one can come first in min-width
sequence--maybe choose one adjacent to another max-degree?
\end{solution}
