\begin{problem}

Suppose $2n+1$ numbers are selected from $\set{1,2,3, \dots,4n}$.
Using the Pigeonhole Principle, show that
there must be two selected numbers whose difference is $2$.
Clearly indicate what are the pigeons, holes, and rules for assigning a pigeon to a hole.

\begin{solution}
  The $2n+1$ selected numbers are the pigeons.
  The pigeonholes will be the sets of the forms $\set{4k+1,4k+3}$ and $\set{4k+2,4k+4}$
  for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1$.
  There are $2n$ holes, so two pigeons must be assigned to some hole and their
  difference will be $2$.
\end{solution}
