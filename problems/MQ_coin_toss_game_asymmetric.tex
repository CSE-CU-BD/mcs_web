\begin{problem}
Consider the following 2 player game. A coin is tossed repeatedly. Turns alternate 
between the two players. The game stops 
after the first Heads come up. If the first time the coin came up Heads is during
player 1's turn, player 1 wins.  On the other hand, if the first time the coin came up Heads is during 
player 2's turn then player 2 wins. 

\ppart What is the probability the game ends?
\begin{solution}
The probability is 1. This is simply the probability that no heads come up ever.
\end{solution}

\ppart What is the expected number of turns until the game ends.
\begin{solution}
The expected number of steps is $1/(1/2) = 2$. As seen in class.
\end{solution}

\ppart What is the probability player 1 wins. (Hint: draw an event tree)
\begin{solution}
The tree can be described by $A = H_1 + T_1(H_2 + T_2A)$ The probability of winning
can be found via the law of total probability. 

$p_A = (1/2)\cdot 1 +  (1/2)(1/2\cdot 0 + 1/2\cdot p_A)$

Hence $(3/4)\cdot p_A = 1/2$, so $p_A = 2/3$

\end{solution}

\ppart What is the expected number of rounds in the game, given player 1 wins $\expect{W | 1}$. Hint:
Assume $\expect{W | 2} = \expect{W | 1} + 1$.  Law of total expectation.

\begin{solution}
From the law of total expectation, we know $\expect{W} = \expect{W|1}p_1 + \expect{W|2}p_2$, 
Now we know $p_1 = 2/3$, $p_2 = 1/3$ and $\expect{W} = 2$ and the hint.

We get $(2/3 +1/3)\expect{W|1} = 2 - 1/3$ so $\expect{W|1} = 5/3$.
\end{solution}

\end{problem}
