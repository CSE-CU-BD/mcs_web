\ppart\label{AindBindbarB} Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are independent events, then so are
$A$ and $\setcomp{B}$.
\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
\begin{align*}
\pr{A \intersect \setcomp{B}}
  &  = \pr{A} - \pr{A \intersect B}
       & \text{(difference rule)}\\
  & =  \pr{A} - \pr{A} \cdot \pr{B}
       & \text{(independence of $A$ and $B$)}\\
  & =  \pr{A} (1 - \pr{B})\\
  & =  \pr{A} \cdot \pr{\setcomp{B}}. & \text{(complement rule)}
\end{align*}

%\ppart
Let $I_A$ and $I_B$ be the indicator variables for events $A$ and $B$.
Prove that $I_A$ and $I_B$ are independent iff $A$ and $B$ are
independent.  

\hint For any event, $E$, let $E^1 \eqdef E$ and $E^0 \eqdef \setcomp{E}$.
So the event $[I_E = a]$ is the same as $E^a$.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
%By part~\eqref{AindBindbarB} and the fact that $\setcomp{\setcomp{E}} =E$, the
By Wednesday's class problem 3(a) and the fact that $\setcomp{\setcomp{E}} =E$, the
following propositions are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item $A$ and $B$ are independent,
\item $\exists a,b \in \set{0,1}$. \ [$A^a$ and $B^b$ are independent],
\item $\forall a,b \in \set{0,1}$. \ [$A^a$ and $B^b$ are independent].
\end{itemize}

Therefore, the following propositions are equivalent as well:
\begin{itemize}
\item $I_A$ and $I_B$ are independent,
\item  $\forall a,b \in \set{0,1}$. [$[I_A = a]$ and $[I_A = b]$ are
  independent events]---by definition of independence for random variables,
\item $\forall a,b \in \set{0,1}$. [$A^a$ and $B^b$ are independent],
%\item $A$ and $B$ are independent---(by part~\eqref{AindBindbarB}).
\item $A$ and $B$ are independent---(by Wednesday's class problem 3(a)).
\end{itemize}

\end{proof}
\end{solution}
