\ppart For any tree $T = (V,G)$, we have that $\chi (T) = 3$.

\ppart For a tree, the maximum number of edges is equal to $|V| -1$.

\ppart If all edges in a weighted graph have distinct weights, then the graph has $2$ different MSTs.

\ppart Every Tree has a perfect matching.

\ppart Any planar graph is 6-colorable.
