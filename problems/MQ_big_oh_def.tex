\begin{problem}
Recall that for functions $f,g$ on
$\naturals$, $f = O(g)$ iff
\begin{equation}\label{Oh}
\exists c \in \naturals\, \exists n_0 \in \naturals\,
\forall n \geq n_0\quad c \cdot g(n) \geq \abs{f(n)}.
\end{equation}

For each pair of functions below, $f = O(g)$.  Indicate the
\emph{smallest nonegative integer}, $c$, and for that smallest $c$, the
\emph{smallest corresponding nonegative integer $n_0$} ensuring that
condition~\eqref{Oh} applies.

\begin{problemparts}

\problempart $f(n) = \sin{n}, g(n) = n$.

$c =$ \brule{.5in}, $n_0$ = \brule{.5in}

\begin{solution}
$c = 1$ and $n_0=0$.
\end{solution}

\problempart $f(n) = \frac{1}{2} \ln{n^2}, g(n) = n$.

$c =$ \brule{.5in}, $n_0$ = \brule{.5in}

\begin{solution}
$f(n)=\ln{n}$, and $n$ exceeds $\ln{n}$ for all nonnegative $n$. 
Thus $c = 1$ and $n_0=0$.  ($n_0=1$ should also be acceptable in case
students suppose that logarithms are undefined, rather than infinitely negative,
at zero.)
\end{solution}

\problempart $f(n) = n, g(n) = n\ln{n}$.

$c =$ \brule{.5in}, $n_0$ = \brule{.5in}

\begin{solution}
Since $\ln{n}$ eventually grows beyond 1, it must be that $n\ln{n}$ eventually grows beyond
$n$.  Thus $c=1$.  Now $f(n)=n\leq cg(n)=g(n)=n\ln{n}$ precisely when $1 \leq \ln{n}$.  That is,
when $n \geq e$.  So $n_0=\lceil e\rceil=3$.
\end{solution}

\problempart $f(n) = 3n^2, g(n) = 2n^2-2n+\frac{3}{2}$.

$c =$ \brule{.5in}, $n_0$ = \brule{.5in}

\begin{solution}
For $cg(n)$ to eventually rival $f(n)$, the $x^2$ term's coefficient in $cg(n)$ 
must be at least as large as the corresponding coefficient in $f(n)$.  So $c$ 
must be at least $\frac{3}{2}$.  The smallest acceptable nonnegative integer value
of $c$ is therefore 2. Now, solve $cg(n)=f(n)$:
\begin{align*}
4n^2-4n+3 &= 3n^2\\
n^2-4n+3&=0\\
(n-3)(n-1)&=0
\end{align*}
So $n=1$ or $n=3$.  Thus $cg(n)\geq f(n)$ for all $n\geq 3$.\\
Conclude that $c = 2$ and $n_0=3$.
\end{solution}

\problempart $f(n) = 3\sin{(n-1)}+2, g(n) = 0.2$.

$c =$ \brule{.5in}, $n_0$ = \brule{.5in}

\begin{solution}
$f(n)$ oscillates between -1 and 5, so the smallest acceptable nonnegative integer
value for $c$ is $\frac{5}{0.2}=25$.  Now, $cg(n)$ exceeds or equals $f(n)$ for all
$n\geq 0$, so $n_0=0$. 
\end{solution}

\end{problemparts}
