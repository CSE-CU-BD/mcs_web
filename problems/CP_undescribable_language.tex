  Though it was a serious challenge for set theorists to overcome
  Russells' Paradox, the idea behind the paradox led to some important
  (and correct \smiley\ ) results in logic and computer science.  In this
  problem we'll apply that idea to describing a set of strings that can't
  be described by ordinary logical formulas about binary strings!

  For example, the using binary strings as the domain of discourse, the
  formula
  \begin{equation}%\tag{\all0s} %\label{no1}
    \QNOT[\exists y\, \exists z.\, s = y1z] \tag{$\sc{no-1s}(s)$}
  \end{equation}
  says that the binary string, $s$, does not contain a 1.

  In general, when $G(s)$ is any predicate formula that defines a property of a
  binary string, $s$, we'll say it \emph{describes} the set of binary
  strings with that property:
\[
\desc(G) \eqdef \set{s \suchthat G(s)}.
\]
So $\desc(\sc{no-1s})$\footnote is the set of all strings of
0's.\footnote{$\sc{no-1s}$ and similar formulas were examined in
  Problem~\bref{CP_assertions_about_binary_strings}, but it is not
  necessary to have done that problem to do this one.}

The idea of representing data in binary should be completely familiar
to a computer scientist, so it won't be a stretch to agree that any
string formula, $G(s)$, can be represented by a binary string.  We'll
use the notation $G_{\mathbf{x}}(s)$ for the string formula with
binary representation $\mathbf{x}$.  The details of the representation
don't matter, except that there ought to be a display procedure that
can actually display $G_{\mathbf{x}}(s)$ given $\mathbf{x}$.  With
typical representations based on character-by-character coding into
binary, most binary strings do not represent string formulas, but
we'll fix this by assuming that the display procedure has been tweaked
to display some default formula, say $\sc{no-1s}(s)$, when it gets a
string that otherwise wouldn't represent a $G(s)$.  With this tweak,
\emph{every} binary string, $\mathbf{x}$, will now represent a string
formula, $G_{\mathbf{x}}(s)$.

Now we have just the kind of situation where a Cantor-style diagonal
argument can be applied, namely, we'll ask whether a string describes a
property of \emph{itself}!  That may sound like a mind-bender, but all
we're asking is whether $\mathbf{x} \in \desc(G_{\mathbf{x}})$.

For example, using typical schemes for binary representation of a
string formula, neither the string $0000$ nor the string $10$ would
represent an actual formula, so the display procedure applied to
either of them would display $\sc{no-1s}$.  That is, $G_{0000} =
G_{10} = \sc{no-1s}$.  That means that $0000 \in \desc(G_{0000})$ and
$10 \notin \desc(G_{10})$.

This puts us in a position to give a perfectly clear and precise
description of an ``undescribable'' set of binary strings, namely, let
\begin{equation}\label{Udefxngx}
U \eqdef \set{\mathbf{x} \suchthat\ \mathbf{x} \notin
  \desc(G_{\mathbf{x}})}.
\end{equation}

Use reasoning similar to Russell's paradox to show that $U$ is not
described by any predicate formula $G(s)$ about binary strings, that is, 
$U \neq \desc(G)$.

\begin{solution}
By definition~\eqref{Udefxngx}, 
\begin{equation}\label{xUiffxGx}
\mathbf{x} \in U \qiff \mathbf{x} \notin \desc(G_{\mathbf{x}}).
\end{equation}
for all binary strings, $\mathbf{x}$.

Now suppose for contradiction that there was a string formula that
described $U$, and let $\mathbf{x_U}$ be the binary representation of
that formula.  That means:
\begin{equation}\label{xUqxGx}
\mathbf{x} \in U \qiff \mathbf{x} \in \desc{G_{\mathbf{x_U}}}.
\end{equation}

Combining~\eqref{xUqxGx} and~\eqref{xUiffxGx}, we have
\begin{equation}\label{xdGiff}
\mathbf{x} \notin \desc{G_{\mathbf{x_U}}} \iff \mathbf{x} \in \desc{G_{\mathbf{x_U}}},
\end{equation}
for all binary strings, \mathbf{x}.  Now plugging in $\mathbf{x_U}$
for $\mathbf{x}$ in~\eqref{xdGiff} gives an immediate contradiction.

So there cannot be any formula that describes $U$.
\end{solution}
