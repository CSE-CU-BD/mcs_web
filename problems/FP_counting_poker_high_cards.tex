\begin{problem}
In a standard 52-card deck (13 ranks and 4 suits),
a hand is a 5-card subset of the set of 52 cards.
Express the answer to each part as a formula using
factorial, binomial, or multinomial notation.

\bparts

\ppart
Let $H$ be the set of all hands. What is $|H|$?
\begin{solution}
$|H| = \binom{52}{5}$
\end{solution}

\ppart
Let $H_{NP}$ be the set of all hands that does not include a pair,
i.e. no two card in the hand have the same rank.
What is $|H_{NP}|$?
\begin{solution}
$|H_{NP}| = \binom{13}{5} \binom{4}{1}^5$
\end{solution}

\ppart
Let $H_{S}$ be the set of all hands that is a straight,
i.e. the rank of the five cards are consecutive.
The order of the ranks is $(A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,k,A)$,
note that $A$ is appears twice.
What is $|H_{S}|$?
\begin{solution}
$|H_{S}| = \binom{10}{1} \binom{4}{1}^5$
\end{solution}

\ppart
Let $H_{F}$ be the set of all hands that is a flush,
i.e. the suit of the five cards are identical.
What is $|H_{F}|$?
\begin{solution}
$|H_{F}| = \binom{13}{5} \binom{4}{1}$
\end{solution}

\ppart
Let $H_{SF}$ be the set of all straight flush hands
that is both a straight and a flush.
What is $|H_{SF}|$?
\begin{solution}
$|H_{SF}| = \binom{10}{1} \binom{4}{1}$
\end{solution}

\ppart
Let $H_{HC}$ be the set of all high card hands
that is hands that do not include a pair,
are not straights, and are not flushs.
What is $|H_{HC}|$?
\begin{solution}
$|H_{HC}| = |H_{NP}| -  |H_{S}| - |H_{F}| + |H_{SF}|
= \binom{13}{5} \binom{4}{1}^5 - \binom{10}{1} \binom{4}{1}^5
  - \binom{13}{5} \binom{4}{1} + \binom{10}{1} \binom{4}{1}
= \left( \binom{4}{1}^5 - \binom{4}{1} \right)
  \left( \binom{13}{5} - \binom{10}{1} \right)$
\end{solution}
