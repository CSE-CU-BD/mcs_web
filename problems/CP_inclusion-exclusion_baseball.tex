\begin{problem}
There are 180 games in the baseball season. A certain player’s
season abides by the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\item He rests (does not play) every 9th game--beginning with game 9
\item He hits a home run every 4th game that he plays--beginning
with game 4
\item He strikes out every 5th game(if he is not resting)--beginning with game 5
\item He cannot strike out and hit a home run in the same game
\end{itemize}

In how many games does the player either not hit a home run or not strikeout (including days he is resting)?

\begin{solution}

We want the union of the sets: A = games he rests, B = games he does
not hit a home run, and C = games he does not strike out. By the
inclusion/exclusion principle:
|A U B U C|  = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ^ B| - |B ^ C| - |A ^ C| + |A ^ B ^ C|
                   = 20 + 135 + 144 - 20 – 108 – 20 + 20
                   = 171

Because, |B ^ C| = 180 - |NOT(B) U NOT(C)

| |NOT(B) U NOT(C)| = |NOT(B)| + |NOT(C)| - |NOT(B) U NOT(C)|
                               = 45 + 36 – 9 = 72
|B ^ C| = 108

\end{solution}
\end{problem}
