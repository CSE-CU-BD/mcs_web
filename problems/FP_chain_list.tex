\begin{problem} 
Let $R$ be a weak partial order on a set, $A$.  Suppose $C$ is a
finite chain.\footnote{A set $C$ is a \emph{chain} when it is nonempty
  and all elements $c,d \in C$ are comparable.  Elements $c$ and $d$
  are \emph{comparable} iff $[c \mrel{R} d\ \QOR\ d \mrel{R} c]$.
  \iffalse A partial order for which every two different elements are
  comparable is called a \emph{linear order}\fi}

size of $C$

\ppart Conclude that there is a unique sequence of all the elements of
$C$ that is strictly increasing.
