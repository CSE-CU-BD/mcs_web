%% type: short-answer
%% title: RSA reversed

\bparts

For communication between two users $A$ and $B$, if $A$ generates the keys, 
RSA encryption scheme allows $B$ to send $A$ a message 
encrypted by the public key that cannot be eavesdropped, 
but since the public key is public, a third party $C$ can pretend to be $B$ 
and send $A$ a message encrypted by the public key.
In this problem we will see RSA can also prevent forged messages.
Using the same keys $A$ had generated, consider when $A$ sends $B$ a message 
encrypted using the private key.

\ppart
How $B$ can read this message?

\begin{solution}
$B$ can decrypt the message using the public key.
Note that encrypt and decrypt operation is the same in RSA.
\end{solution}

\ppart
%n = p * q = 29 * 37 = 1073 
%phi(n) = 28 * 26 = 1008
%e,d = 605,5 
Given the public key (5, 1073), and the encrypted message 33, 
what is the original message?

\begin{solution}
The original message is $rem(33^5, 1073) = 937$
\end{solution}

\ppart
Why cannot this message be forged?

\begin{solution}
Because only $A$ knows the private key.
\end{solution}
