\begin{problem} \textbf{Asymptotics}
\begin{problemparts} 

\problempart
Define a function $f(n)$ such that $f = \Theta(n^4)$ and $\QNOT (f \sim n^4)$.

$f(n) = $\examrule[1in]

\begin{solution}
$2n^4$
\end{solution}

\problempart
Define a function $g(n)$ such that $g = O(n^4)$, $g \neq \Theta(n^4)$ and $g \neq o(n^4)$.

$g(n) = $\examrule[3in]

\begin{solution}
$n^4\sin\paren{\frac{n\pi}{2}} + n^4\cos\paren{\frac{n\pi}{2}}$
\end{solution}

\ppart For each of the asymptotic relations below on the set of
nonnegative real-valued functions, indicate whether it is
\emph{transitive} but not a partial order (\textbf{Tr}), a \emph{total
order} (\textbf{Tot}), a \emph{strict partial order} that is not total
(\textbf{Str}), a \emph{weak partial order} that is not total (\textbf{Wk}),
or \emph{none} of the above (\textbf{Non}).

\begin{itemize}

\item the ``asymptotically equal'' relation, $f \sim g$. \examrule

\item  the ``Little Oh'' relation, $f=o(g)$, \examrule

\item  the ``Big Oh'' relation, $f=O(g)$, \examrule

\item The ``Theta'' relation, $f=\Theta(g)$, \examrule

\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}
big Oh is \textbf{Tr}, little Oh is \textbf{S}, sim is
\textbf{Tr}.
\end{solution}
