\begin{problem} %\textbf{Asymptotics}
\mbox{ }

\begin{problemparts} 

\problempart[1]
Define a function $f(n)$ such that
\[
f = \Theta(n^4) \QAND \QNOT (f \sim n^4).
\]

$f(n) = $\examrule[1in]

\begin{solution}
$2n^4$
\end{solution}

\problempart[2]
Define a function $g(n)$ such that $g = O(n^4)$, $g \neq \Theta(n^4)$ and $g \neq o(n^4)$.

$g(n) = $\examrule[3in]

\begin{solution}
One example is,
\[
\begin{cases}
n^4 & \text{if $n$ is odd},\\
0   & \text{if $n$ is even},
\end{cases}
\]
which can also be described by the formula
\[
n^4\sin\paren{\frac{n\pi}{2}},
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart[2] For each of the asymptotic relations below on the set of
nonnegative real-valued functions, indicate whether it is
\emph{transitive} but not a partial order (\textbf{Tr}), a \emph{total
order} (\textbf{Tot}), a \emph{strict partial order} that is not total
(\textbf{Str}), a \emph{weak partial order} that is not total (\textbf{Wk}),
or \emph{none} of the above (\textbf{Non}).

\begin{itemize}

\item $f \sim g$, the ``asymptotically Equal'' relation. \hfill \examrule

\item $f=o(g)$,  the ``little Oh'' relation. \hfill \examrule

\item $f=O(g)$,  the ``big Oh'' relation. \hfill \examrule

\item $f=\Theta(g)$, the ``Theta'' relation. \hfill \examrule

\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

\begin{itemize}
\item Asymptotically Equal is \textbf{Tr}.
\item Lttle Oh is \textbf{Str},
\item Big Oh is \textbf{Tr} (as it is not antisymmetric),
\item Theta is \textbf{Tr}.

\end{itemize}

\end{solution}
