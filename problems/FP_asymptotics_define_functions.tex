\begin{problem} %\textbf{Asymptotics}
\mbox{ }

\begin{problemparts} 

\problempart
Define two functions $f, g$ that are incomparable under big Oh:
\[
f \neq O(g) \QAND g \neq O(f).
\]

\examspace[1.5in]

\begin{solution}
One example is,
\[
f(n) \eqdef \begin{cases}            
n & \text{if $n$ is odd},\\
0   & \text{if $n$ is even}, 
\end{cases}\qquad
g(n) \eqdef \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if $n$ is odd},\\
n   & \text{if $n$ is even}, 
\end{cases}
\]
which can also be described by the formulas
\[
f(n) \eqdef n\sin\paren{\frac{n\pi}{2}}, \qquad g(n) \eqdef n\cos\paren{\frac{n\pi}{2}}.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart Indicate which of the following asymptotic relations below
on the set of nonnegative real-valued functions are
\emph{equivalence relations}, (\textbf{Eqv}), strict
partial orders (\textbf{SPO}), weak 
partial orders (\textbf{WPO}), or \emph{none} of the above
(\textbf{Non}).

\begin{itemize}

\item $f \sim g$, the ``asymptotically Equal'' relation. \hfill \examrule

\item $f=o(g)$,  the ``little Oh'' relation. \hfill \examrule

\item $f=O(g)$,  the ``big Oh'' relation. \hfill \examrule

\item $f=\Theta(g)$, the ``Theta'' relation. \hfill \examrule

\item $f=O(g) \QAND \QNOT(g=O(f))$. \hfill \examrule

\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

\begin{itemize}
\item Asymptotic  equality is \textbf{Eqv}.
\item Little Oh is \textbf{PO},
\item Big Oh is \textbf{Non} (as it is not antisymmetric),
\item Theta is \textbf{Eqv},
\item the $\QAND$ relation is \textbf{PO},

\end{itemize}

\end{solution}
