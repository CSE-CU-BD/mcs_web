\begin{problem}
The simplest example of a simple graph with chromatic number $n$ is
the complete graph on $n$ vertices, that is $\chi(K_n)=n$.  It follows
that any graph with $K_n$ as a subgraph must have chromatic number at
least $n$.  It's a common misconception to think that graphs with high
chromatic number must contain a large complete subgraph.  In this
problem we exhibit a simple example countering this misconception,
namely a graph with chromatic number four that contains no triangle,
that is, no subgraph isomorphic to $K_3$.  Namely, let $G$ be the
$11$-vertex graph of Figure~\ref{fig:coloring_no_triangles}.

\ppart Show that $G$ is 4-colorable.

\begin{solution}
  Figure \ref{fig:coloring_no_triangles_solution} shows a valid coloring.

\end{figure}
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{fgateforNOTOR} Show that $G$ can't be colored with $3$
colors.

\begin{solution}
   Assume by contradiction that there is one coloring using only 3
   colors: red, blue and green. First, consider only the outer
   pentagon of the graph. Notice that it is impossible to color it
   using only two colors.  Thus, we can assume that the outer pentagon
   is colored as shown in the left of Figure
   \ref{fig:coloring_no_triangles_solution2}.

  Now, observe that there are three points in the interior whose color
  is determined, as shown in the right of Figure
  \ref{fig:coloring_no_triangles_solution2}.  Note that the point in
  the center has neighbors with all three colors so it is impossible
  to color it.
