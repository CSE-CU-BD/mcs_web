\begin{problem}
There are lots of different sizes of infinite sets.  For example, starting
with the infinite set, $\naturals$, of nonnegative integers, we can build
the infinite sequence of sets
\[
\naturals \strict \power(\naturals) \strict \power(\power(\naturals))
\strict \power(\power(\power(\naturals))) \strict \dots.
\]
where each set is ``strictly smaller'' than the next one by
Theorem~\bref{powbig}.  Let $\power^n(\naturals)$ be the $n$th set in
the sequence, and
  \[
  U \eqdef \lgunion_{n=0}^\infty \power^n(\naturals).
  \]
Prove that
\[
\power^n(\naturals) \strict U
\]
for all $n \in \naturals$.

Now of course, we could take $U, \power(U), \power(\power(U)), \dots$
and keep on in this way building still bigger infinities indefinitely.

\begin{solution}
Everything follows from a trivial observation: if $A \supseteq B$, then $A
\surj B$.  (Why is this trivial?)

So since $U \supseteq \power^n(\naturals)$, we have $U \surj
\power^n(\naturals)$, which proves~\ref{Usp}.

To prove~\ref{nopsU}, assume to the contrary that $\power^m(\naturals)
\surj U$.  Now we know from~\ref{Usp} that $U \surj
\power^{m+1}(\naturals)$.  But this implies that
\[
\power^m(\naturals)
\surj \power^{m+1}(\naturals) = \power(\power^m(\naturals)),
\]
contradicting the fact that, by Theorem~\bref{powbig}, a power set of
$\power^m(\naturals))$ is ``strictly bigger'' than $\power^m(\naturals))$.
\end{solution}
