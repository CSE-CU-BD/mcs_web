\documentclass[quiz]{mcs}\begin{problem}
For each of the binary relations below, select any of the properties terms that apply to it (to add: multiple
choice reflexive, transitive, symmetric, anti-symmetric, strict partial, weak partial)

\bparts
\ppart The relation $\mrel{R}$ between any two integers, $a$, $b$ such that $(a,b) \in \mrel{R}$
if and only if $a = b + 1$.

\begin{solution}
not reflexive, not symmetric, not transitive (hence not partial anything), but it is anti-symmetric vacuously.
\end{solution}

\ppart The superset relation, $\supseteq$ on the power set of the integers.

\begin{solution}
reflexive, transitive, not symmetric, but anti-symmetric. not strict partial. weak partial.
\end{solution}

\ppart The relation $\mrel{Q}$ between random variables with a finite expectation, where $(R_1, R_2) \in Q$ if and only if $\expect{R_1} < \expect{R_2}$
\begin{solution}
not reflexive, transitive, not symmetric, anti-symmetric (vacuously), strict partial.
\end{solution}

\ppart The \idx{empty relation} on the set of rationals.
\begin{solution}
reflexive, transitive, symmetric, anti-symmetric, strict-partial, weak-partial.
\end{solution}
