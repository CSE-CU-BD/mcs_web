\begin{problem}
Say that vertices $u,v$ in a digraph $G$ are \emph{mutually connected}
and write
\[
u \mutcon v,
\]
when there is a path from $u$ to $v$ and also a path from $v$ to $u$.

\bparts

\ppart Prove that \mutcon\ is an equivalence relation on
$\vertices{G}$.

\begin{solution}
\TBA{TBA}
\end{solution}

\ppart The blocks of the equivalence relation \mutcon\ are called the
\emph{strongly connected components} of $G$.  Define a relation
\reach\ on the strongly connected components of $G$ by the rule
\[
C \reach D\quad \QIFF \text{ there is a path from some vertex in $C$
  to some vertex in $D$}.
\]

Prove that \reach\ is a weak partial order on the strongly connected
components.
