\begin{problem}
  How many paths are there from point $(0, 0)$ to $(50, 50)$ if every step
  increments one coordinate and leaves the other unchanged?  How many are
  there when there are impassable boulders sitting at points $(10, 11)$
  and $(21, 20)$?  (You do not have to calculate the number explicitly;
  your answer may be an expression involving binomial coefficients.)

\hint Count the number of paths going through $(10,11)$, the number
through $(21,20)$, and use Inclusion-Exclusion.

\begin{solution}
We use Inclusion-Exclusion.  The total number of paths is
$\binom{100}{50}$, but we must subtract off the obstructed paths.
There are $\binom{21}{10} \cdot \binom{79}{40}$ paths through the
first boulder, since there are $\binom{21}{10}$ paths from the start
to the first boulder and $\binom{79}{40}$ paths from the boulder to
the finish.  Similarly, there are $\binom{41}{20} \cdot
\binom{59}{30}$ paths through the second boulder.  However, we must
subtract off paths going through both boulders, and there are
$\binom{21}{10} \cdot \binom{20}{9} \cdot \binom{59}{30}$ of those.
Therefore, the total number of paths is: %
\[
\binom{100}{50} - \binom{21}{10} \cdot \binom{79}{40} - \binom{41}{20}
\cdot \binom{59}{30} + \binom{20}{10} \cdot \binom{20}{9} \cdot
\binom{59}{30}
\]

\end{solution}
