\begin{problem}
If $a$ and $b$ are distinct nodes of a digraph, then $a$ is said to
\term{cover} $b$ if there is an edge from $a$ to $b$ and every path from
$a$ to $b$ traverses this edge.  If $a$ covers $b$, the edge from $a$ to
$b$ is called a \term{covering edge}.

\ppart What are the covering edges in the following DAG?

\ppart\label{cover-ok} Let $\covering{D}$ be the subgraph of $D$
consisting of only the covering edges.  Suppose $D$ is a finite \idx{DAG}.
Explain why $\covering{D}$ has the same positive path relation as $D$.

\hint Consider \emph{longest} paths between a pair of vertices.

\begin{solution}
What we need to show is that if there is a path in $D$ between
vertices $a \neq b$, then there is a path consisting only of covering
edges from $a$ to $b$.  But since $D$ is a finite DAG, there must be a
\emph{longest} path from $a$ to $b$.  Now every edge on this path must be a
covering edge or it could be replaced by a path of length 2 or more,
yielding a longer path from $a$ to $b$.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{+path=} Show that if two \emph{DAG}'s have the same positive
path relation, then they have the same set of covering edges.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}

Suppose $C$ and $D$ are DAG's with the same positive path relation and
that $\diredge{a}{b}$ is a covering edge of $C$.  We want to show that
$\diredge{a}{b}$ must also be a covering edge of $D$.

Since $\diredge{a}{b}$ itself defines a (length one) positive length
path in $C$, there must be a positive length path in $D$ from $a$ to
$b$.  If this positive length path in $D$ is of length greater than one,
then the path must consist of a positive length path from $a$ to $c$
followed by a positive length path from $c$ to $b$ for some vertex, $c$.
Also, since $D$ is a DAG, $c$ cannot be $a$ or $b$.

This means there must also be positive length paths in $C$ from $a$ to $c$
and from $c$ to $b$, and neither of these paths can traverse
$\diredge{a}{b}$ or there would be a cycle.  Hence the path from $a$ to
$c$ to $b$ is a path in $C$ that does not traverse $\diredge{a}{b}$,
contradicting the fact that $\diredge{a}{b}$ is a covering edge of $C$.

In sum, there is a length one path from $a$ to $b$ in $D$, namely
$\diredge{a}{b}$, and this is the \emph{only} path from $a$ to $b$ in $D$,
which proves that $\diredge{a}{b}$ is a covering edge in $D$.
\end{proof}

\end{solution}

\ppart Conclude that $\covering{D}$ is the \emph{unique} DAG with the smallest
number of edges among all digraphs with the same positive path relation as
$D$.

\begin{solution}
  By part~\eqref{+path=}, any DAG with the same positive path relation as
  $D$ must contain all the edges of $\covering{D}$.  By part~\eqref{cover-ok},
  $\covering{D}$ has this same positive path relation.  It follows
  immediately that $\covering{D}$ is the unique minimum-size DAG with the
  same positive path relation as $D$.
\end{solution}

\iffalse
\ppart Show that the previous result is not true in general infinite
DAG's.

\hint Consider the DAG for the total order on the rational numbers.

\begin{solution}
In the DAG for $<$ on the $\rationals$, there are no covering
edges, so $\widehat{<}$ has no edges.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{12pospath} Describe two graphs with vertices $\set{1,2}$
which have the same set of covering edges, but not the same positive path
relation (\hint Self-loops.)

\begin{solution}
  Let one graph have edges $\set{(1,2), (1,1)}$ and the other
  $\set{(1,2),(2,2)}$.  They have the same set of covering edges, namely,
  $(1,2)$.  But in the second there is a positive length path from 2 to 2,
  namely a path of length one but there is no positive length path from 2
  to 2 in the first graph.
\end{solution}

\begin{enumerate}

\item What are the covering edges of the
\term{complete digraph} with vertices $1,2,3$ which has edges between every
two distinct vertices?

\item What are the covering edges of the graph with vertices $1,2,3$ and
  edges $\diredge{1}{2}, \diredge{2}{3}, \diredge{3}{2}, \diredge{3}{1}$.

\item What about their positive path relations?

\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
\begin{enumerate}

\item There are no covering edges, since there is always a length two path from
 $a$ to $b$ that does not use the edge $\diredge{a}{b}$.

\item  $\diredge{1}{2}$ and $\diredge{3}{1}$ are the covering edges.

\item They have the same positive path relation, namely, each vertex is
  connected to all the vertices, including itself, by positive length
  paths.

\end{enumerate}

\iffalse
Let $D$ be a finite Directed Acyclic Graph (\idx{DAG}).

\bparts

\ppart Explain in one (maybe two) sentences why the \idx{positive path
  relation} of $D$ is obviously a strict partial order.

\begin{solution}
Since following a path from $x$ to $y$ and then a path from $y$ to $z$ is
itself a path from $x$ to $z$, transitivity of the path relation (positive
or not) is immediate.  Also, a path from $x$ to $y$ combined with a path
from $y$ to $x$ would be a cycle, so if a graph is acyclic, its path
relation must be asymmetrical.
\end{solution}
