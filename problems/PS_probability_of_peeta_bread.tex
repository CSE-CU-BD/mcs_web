\begin{problem}
Peeta bakes between $1$ and $2n$ loaves of bread to sell every day.
Each day he rolls a fair, $n$-sided die to get a number from $1-n$,
then flips a fair coin. If the coin is heads,
he bakes a number of loaves of bread equal to the value on the die,
and if the coin is tails, he bakes twice that many loaves.

\begin{problemparts}

\ppart For any positive integer $k \le 2n$, What is the probability
that Peeta will make $k$ loaves of bread on any given day?
(You can express your solution by cases.)
\begin{solution}
If $k$ is odd and $k \le n$, then the probability is $\frac{1}{n}$.
If $k$ is even and $k \le n$, then the probability is $\frac{2}{n}$.
If $k$ is odd and $k > n$, then the probability is $0$.
If $k$ is even and $k > n$, then the probability is $\frac{1}{n}$.
\end{solution}

\ppart What is the expected number of loaves Peeta will bake on any given day?
\begin{solution}
$\frac{1}{2n} \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} (1+2) \right) = \frac{3}{4}(n+1)$
ANSWER: (3n)/2
\end{solution}

\ppart Continuing this process, Peeta bakes bread every day for 30 days.
What is the expected total number of loaves Peeta will have baked?
\begin{solution}
$30 \left( \frac{3}{4}(n+1) \right) = \frac{45}{2}(n+1)$
\end{solution}
