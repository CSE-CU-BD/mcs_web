\begin{problem}

Alyssa Hacker sends out a video that spreads like wildfire over the
UToob network. On the day of the release (call it zero-day) and the
very next day the video doesn't receive any hits.  However,
starting with day 2, the number of hits, $r_n$,  can be expressed
as seven times the number of hits on the previous day, four times
the number of hits the day before that, and the number of days that
has passed since the release of the video plus one.  So, for example
on day 2, there will be $7 \times 0 + 4 \times 0 + 3 = 3$ hits.

Provide a recurrence that models the number of hits that the video receives on day $n$.
 
Express the generating function of this
sequence as a
quotient of polynomials or products of polynomials.  You do \emph{not}
have to find a closed form for $r_n$.

\begin{solution}
  Reasoning as in the derivation of the generating
  function for the orginal Fibonacci numbers, we have
\[
\begin{array}{rcrcrcrcrcr}
R(x)      & = & r_0 & + & r_1  x & + & r_2 x^2 & + & r_3 x^3 & + & r_4 x^4 + \cdots.\\
-7xR(x)   & = &     & - & 7r_0  x & - & 7r_1 x^2 & - & 7r_2 x^3 & - & 7r_3 x^4 - \cdots.\\
-4x^2R(x) & = &     &   &        & - & 4r_0 x^2 & - & 4r_1 x^3 & - & 4r_2 x^4 - \cdots.\\
\hline
R(x)(1-7x-4x^2)
         & = & r_0 & + & (r_1-7r_0)
                              x & + & (r_2 - 7r_1 - 4r_0)
                                          x^2 & + & \cdots & & \\
         & = &  0  & + & 0     & + & 3 x^2 & + & 4 x^3 + \cdots.\\
\end{array}
\]

Let the right hand side be $F(x)$, we have $F(x)=3x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4 +
\cdots$.
\[
 F(x) - xF(x) = 3x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + \cdots = G(x)
\]
 \[
  G(x) - xG(x) = 3x^2 - 2x^3  \Longrightarrow G(x) = \frac{3x^2 -
    2x^3}{1-x}
 \]
 We have $F(x) = \frac{G(x)}{1-x} = \frac{3x^2 - 2x^3}{(1-x)^2}$,

so
%\begin{equation}\label{Rfracx1}
\[
R(x) = \frac{F(x)}{1 - 7x - 4x^2} = \frac{3x^2 - 2x^3}{(1-x)^2(1-7x-4x^2)}\, .
\]
%\end{equation}

\end{solution}
