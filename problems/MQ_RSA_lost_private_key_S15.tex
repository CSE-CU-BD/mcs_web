\begin{problem}
% Tests understanding of RSA encryption strategies

Ben Bitdiddle decided to encrypt all his data using RSA. Unfortunately he lost his private key. He has been looking for it all night, and suddenly a genie emerges from his lamp. He offers Ben a quantum computer that can perform exactly one procedure. Which of the following procedures should Ben choose to recover his data? (No partial credit will be given for this problem, and no explanation is necessary.)

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Given very large numbers $x$, $y$, find $gcd(x, y)$.
\item Given a large number $x$, find the prime factorization of $x$.
\item Given a large number $x$, determine with 100\% certainty whether or not $x$ is prime.
\end{enumerate}
