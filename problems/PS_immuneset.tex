\begin{problem}
Let
\[
f_0, f_1, f_2, \dots, f_k,\dots
\]
be an infinite sequence of partial functions $f_k:\nngint \to \nngint$.

Define a total function $g: \nngint \to \nngint$ and a set $C_n \subset \nngint$ recursively:
\[
g(0) \eqdef 0, \quad C_0 \eqdef \emptyset.
\]
Let
\[
k_{n+1} \eqdef \min\set{k \notin C_n \suchthat f_k(n) \geq 2k}, 
\]
Then,
\[
g(n+1) \eqdef f_{k_{n+1}}(n), \quad C_{n+1} \eqdef C_n \union \set{k_{n+1}}.
\]

Let $U$ be the complement $\bar{\range{g}}$ of $\range{g}$.

\bparts

\ppart Show that $U$ is infinite.

\begin{solution}
Note that $\range{g}$ can contain at most $k$ elements that are $\leq 2k$, because \TBA{TBA}

If $m \in \range{g}$, then $m$ must be in $\range{f_k}$ for some $k \leq m/2$.
can have at most $n$ elements that are $\leq 2n$

\end{solution}
\ppart Show that for all $k \in \nngint$, if $\range{f_k}$ is infinite, then
\[
QNOT(\range{f_k} \subseteq U).
\]
