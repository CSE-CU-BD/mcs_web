\ppart
For the graph below, list all the discrete faces (simple cycles 
that define the region borders).

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=1in]{figures/planar_graph.pdf}
\end{center}

\examspace[2in]

\begin{solution}
  adea, abea, befb, bcfb, cfgc, abcgfeda
\end{solution}

\ppart
Draw a graph isomorphic to the graph above but has different planar
embeddings. Also describe the discrete faces of the graph you drew.

\examspace[4in]

\begin{solution}
  The graph below has the following faces:
  adea, abea, befb, bcgfb, cfgc, abcfeda
