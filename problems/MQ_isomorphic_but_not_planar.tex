\ppart
For the planar embedding picture below, list all the discrete faces 
(simple cycles that define the region borders).

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=1in]{planar_graph}
\end{center}

\examspace[2in]

\begin{solution}
  adea, abea, befb, bcfb, cfgc, abcgfeda
\end{solution}

\ppart
Provide a drawing of a different planar embedding of the graph 
above. Also list all the faces of the embedding.

\examspace[4in]

\begin{solution}
  The planar drawing below has the following faces:
  adea, abea, befb, bcgfb, cfgc, abcfeda
  
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=1in]{planar_graph_folded}
  \end{center}
