\begin{problem}
Prove by induction on $n$ that
\hyperdef{geometric}{sum}{\begin{equation}\label{geometric-n}
1+r+r^2+\cdots+r^n = \frac{r^{n+1}-1}{r-1}
\end{equation}}
for all $n \in \naturals$ and numbers $r\neq 1$.

\begin{solution}
See \href{http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/fall09/slides4m.pdf}{Slides 4M}.
\end{solution}
