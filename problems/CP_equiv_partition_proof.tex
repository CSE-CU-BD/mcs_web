\begin{problem}
\inbook{Prove Theorem~\bref{equiv-partition_thm}:} The
\idx{equivalence classes} of an \idx{equivalence relation} form a
\idx{partition} of the domain.

Namely, let $R$ be an equivalence relation on a set, $A$, and define
the \idx{equivalence class} of an element $a \in A$ to be
\[
[a]_R \eqdef \set{b \in A \suchthat a\mrel{R}b}.
\]

\bparts

\ppart Prove that every block is nonempty and every element of $A$ is
in some block.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
Since $R$ is reflexive, any element $a \in A$ is a member of the block
$[a]_R$ and also each block $[a]_R$ is nonempty.
\end{proof}
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{nonempt_impaRb} Prove that if $[a]_R \intersect [b]_R
\neq \emptyset$, then $a\mrel{R}b$.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $c \in [a]_R \intersect [b]_R$, that is, $a\mrel{R}c$ and
$b\mrel{R}c$.  Since $b\mrel{R}c$, we have $c\mrel{R}b$ by symmetry.
Since $a\mrel{R}c$, we now conclude by transitivity that $a\mrel{R}b$.
\end{proof}
\end{solution}

\ppart Suppose that $a\mrel{R}b$ is true. Prove that $[a]_R \subseteq [b]_R$, and conclude that $[a]_R =
       [b]_R$.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
Now if $x \in [b]_R$, then $b \mrel{R} x$, and since $a\mrel{R}b$ by
part~\eqref{nonempt_impaRb}, we again invoke transitivity to conclude
that $a \mrel{R} x$.  That is, $x \in [a]_R$.  So every element of
$[b]_R$ is in $[a]_R$, which means that $[b]_R \subseteq [a]_R$.

Reversing the roles of $a$ and $b$, it follows that $[a]_R \subseteq
[b]_R$, so in fact $[a]_R = [b]_R$.
\end{proof}
\end{solution}
