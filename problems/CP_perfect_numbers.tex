\begin{problem}
A number is \emph{perfect} if it is equal to the sum of its positive
divisors, other than itself.  For example, 6 is perfect, because $6 =
1 + 2 + 3$.  Similarly, 28 is perfect, because $28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 +
14$.  Explain why $2^{k-1} (2^k - 1)$ is perfect when $2^k - 1$ is
prime.\footnote{\idx{Euclid} proved this 2300 years ago.  About 250
  years ago, \idx{Euler} proved the converse: \emph{every} even
  \idx{perfect number} is of this form (for a simple proof see
  \href{http://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/EvenPerfect.html}
       {\texttt{http://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/EvenPerfect.html}}).
       As is typical in number theory, apparently simple results lie
       at the brink of the unknown.  For example, it is not known if
       there are an infinite number of even perfect numbers or any odd
       perfect numbers at all.}

\begin{solution}
If $2^k - 1$ is prime, then the only divisors of
$2^{k-1} (2^k - 1)$ are:
\begin{equation}\label{pow2hatk-1}
1,\quad 2,\quad 4,\quad \ldots,\quad 2^{k-1},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{pow2pow2kless1}
1 \cdot (2^k - 1),\quad 2 \cdot (2^k - 1),\quad 4 \cdot (2^k - 1),\quad
   \ldots,\quad 2^{k-2} \cdot (2^k - 1).
\end{equation}
The sequence~\eqref{pow2hatk-1} sums to $2^k-1$ (using the formula for
a geometric series,\footnote{It's fun to notice the ``computer
  science'' proof that~\eqref{pow2hatk-1} sums to $2^k-1$.  The binary
  binary representation of $2^j$ is a $\mathtt{10}^j$, so the sum is
  represented by $\mathtt{1}^k$.  This what you get by subtracting 1
  from by $\mathtt{10}^k$ which is the binary representation of
  $2^k$.} and likewise the sequence~\eqref{pow2pow2kless1} sums to
$(2^{k-1} - 1) \cdot (2^k - 1)$.  Adding these two sums gives $2^{k-1}
(2^k - 1)$, so the number is perfect.
\end{solution}
