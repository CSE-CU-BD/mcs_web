\begin{problem}
For any set $x$, define $\nextset{x}$ to be the set consisting of all
the elements of $x$, along with $x$ itself:
\[
\nextset{x}  \eqdef x \union \set{x}.
\]
So by definition,
\begin{equation}\label{insubset}
x \in \nextset{x}\text{ and }x \subset \nextset{x}.
\end{equation}

Now we give a recursive definition of a collection, $\Ord$, of sets
called \term{ordinals} that provide a way to count infinite sets.
Namely,
\begin{definition*}
\begin{align*}
\emptyset & \in \Ord,\\
\text{if } \nu & \in \Ord, \text{ then } \nextset{\nu} \in \Ord,\\
\text{if } S & \subset \Ord, \text{ then } \lgunion_{\nu \in S} \nu \in \Ord.
\end{align*}
\end{definition*}
There is a method for proving things about ordinals that follows
directly from the way they are defined.  Namely, let $P(\nu)$ be some
property of ordinals.  The \emph{Ordinal Induction Rule} says that to
prove that $P(\nu)$ is true for all ordinals, you need only show two things
\begin{itemize}
\item If $P$ holds for all the members of $\nextset{x}$, then it holds
  for $\nextset{x}$, and
\item if $P$ holds for all members of some set $S$, then it holds for
  $\lgunion_{x \in S} x$.
\end{itemize}  That is:

\LabelRule{\forall x.\ (\forall y \in \nextset{x}.\, P(y))\ \QIMPLIES\ P(\nextset{x}),\\
\forall S.\ (\forall x \in S.\, P(x))\ \QIMPLIES\ P(\lgunion_{x \in S} x)}
{\forall \nu \in \Ord.\, P(\nu)}
{Ordinal Induction}

The intuitive justification for the Ordinal Induction Rule is similar
to the justification for strong induction.  We will accept the
soundness of the Ordinal Induction Rule as a basic axiom.

\ppart A set $c$ is \emph{closed under membership} if for all sets $a,b$,
\[
a \in b \in c\ \QIMPLIES\ a \in c.
\]
Prove that every ordinal $\nu$ is closed under membership.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
The proof is by Ordinal Induction with hypothesis
\[
P(x) \eqdef x \text{ is closed under membership}.
\]

Let $x$ be a set,

\inductioncase{Case: ($\nextset{x}$)}: Suppose every $y \in \nextset{x}$ is
closed under membership.  We need to prove that $\nextset{x}$ is
closed under membership.  To do this, suppose $a \in b \in
\nextset{x}$ for some sets $a,b$.  Then we need to show that $a \in
\nextset{x}$.

Now $x \subset \nextset{x}$ by~\eqref{insubset}, so it is enough to
show that $a \in x$.

Now there are two cases: if $b = x$ then $a \in x$ trivially.  On the
other hand, if $b \neq x$, then $b$ must be a member of $x$ by
definition of $\nextset{x}$.  Moreover, $x$ is closed under membership
since it is a member of $\nextset{x}$.  Therefore, $a \in x$ in this
case too.

\inductioncase{Case: ($\lgunion$)}: Let $S$ be a set, $U \eqdef
\lgunion_{x \in S} x$, and suppose every $x$ in $S$ is closed under
membership.  We need to prove that $U$ is closed under membership.  To
do this, suppose $a \in b \in U$ for some sets $a,b$.  Then we need to
show that $a \in U$.

But $b$ must be a member of $x_0$ for some $x_0 \in S$ by definition
of $U$.  Moreover, $x_0$ will be closed under membership by
hypothesis, and so $a \in x_0$.  But $x_0 \subset U$ by definition of
$U$, and hence $a \in U$.
\end{proof}

\end{solution}

\ppart Prove that if $\mu,\nu$ are different ordinals, then
$\nu \in \mu \QOR\ \mu \in \nu$.

\begin{solution}
By Ordinal Induction with
\[
P(\nu) \eqdef \forall \mu \in \Ord.\ \nu \in \mu \QOR\ \mu \in \nu.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart A sequence
\begin{equation}\label{indecreasing}
\cdots \in \nu_{n+1} \in \nu_n \in \cdots \in \nu_1 \in \nu_0
\end{equation}
of ordinals $\nu_i$ is called a \emph{member-decreasing} sequence
starting at $\nu_0$.  Use Ordinal Induction to prove that no ordinal
starts an infinite member-decreasing sequence.\footnote{Do not assume
  the Foundation Axiom of ZFC (Section~\bref{ZFC_sec}) which says that
  there isn't \emph{any} set that starts an infinite member-decreasing
  sequence.  Even in versions of set theory in which the Foundation
  Axiom does not hold, there cannot be any infinite member-decreasing
  sequence of ordinals.}

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
By Ordinal Induction with
\[
P(\nu) \eqdef \nu \text{ does not start an infinite member-decreasing
  sequence}.
\]
\end{proof}
\end{solution}

\begin{editingnotes}
Maybe add discussion that ordinals can serve as a measure of set size.
Define
\[
\card{S} \eqdef \text{the member-minimal } \nu \in \Ord\text{ such that } S \bij \nu.
\]
