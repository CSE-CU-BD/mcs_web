\begin{problem}
Let RSA public key $(e,n)$ and private key $(d,n)$
be generate by $200$ digit primes $p$ and $q$.
If a message $m$, where $0<m<n$, that happens to be a multiple of $p$ is found,
then RSA can be cracked by using $m$ and public key $(e,n)$ to reproduce
$p=gcd(n, m)$, $q=n/p$, $d=e^{-1} \pmod{(p-1)(q-1)}$.
What is the probability that a random message satifies this property?
Choose the closest:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\frac{1}{200}$
\item $\frac{1}{400}$
\item $\frac{1}{200^{10}}$
\item $\frac{1}{400^{10}}$
\item $\frac{1}{10^{200}}$
\item $\frac{1}{10^{400}}$
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}
The probability of a random integer is a multiple of $p$ is $\frac{1}{p}$.
Since $p$ is a 200 digit prime, $p$ is approximately $10^{200}$,
so the probability is $\frac{1}{10^{200}}$.
\end{solution}
