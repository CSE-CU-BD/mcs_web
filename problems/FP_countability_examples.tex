\begin{problem}
Find an example for $A$ and $B$,
such that $\mathbb{N}$ strict $A$ strict $B$.
($X$ strict $Y$ means there exists a surjective
function from $Y$ to $X$, but no surjective
function exists from $X$ to $Y$.)

\begin{solution}
$A$: real numbers; $B$: powerset of real numbers.
\end{solution}
