\ppart Prove using the Well Ordering Principle that using 6\textcent,
  15\textcent, and 21\textcent\ stamps, it is possible to
  make any amount of postage over 50\textcent.  You may assume that
  any postage amount from 50\textcent\ to 71\textcent\ is makeable.

\ppart Indicate which amounts your proof assumes are makeable. 
\inbook{
\ppart Why isn't 49\textcent\ a makeable amount?
\begin{solution}
\begin{tabular}{}
at & most one 21.
   & if & one 21, then at most one 15.
   &    & if one 21 and one 15,
   &    & then 49-(21+15) = 13 is not a multiple of 6, so not makeable.
   &    & if one 21 and no 15,
   &    & then 49-21 = 28 is not a multiple of 6, so not makeable.
   &if no 21,
   &    & then at most three 15's,
   &    & but none of (49-45), (49-30), and (49-15) are multiples of 6, so not makeable.
