\begin{problem}
Figure \ref{fig:img} shows the arrow diagram for a relation, $R$.

\begin{figure}[h]

\ppart What is the image under $R$ of the even numbers in domain $X$?\hfill\brule{1.5in}

\ppart What is the inverse image under $R$ of the vowels in codomain $Y$?\hfill\brule{1.5in}

\ppart List the first letters of \emph{all} the properties below
satisfied by relation $R$.\hfill\brule{1.0in}
