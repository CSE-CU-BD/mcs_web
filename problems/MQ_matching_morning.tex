\begin{problem}
% 

Consider the bipartite graph $H$ in Figure~\ref{fig:deg_constrained_bipartite}.  Is it possible to find a matching that covers $L(H)$?
If yes, briefly explain why there is no bottleneck in the graph.

\begin{figure}[h]
\graphic{MQ_degree_constrained_bipartite}
\caption{$H$.\label{fig:deg_constrained_bipartite}}
\end{figure}

\begin{solution}
A matching is guaranteed to exist.  Each vertex in $L(H)$ has degree at least 3, while each vertex in $R(H)$ has degree at most 3.  Consequently,
the graph is degree-constrained.  There are therefore no bottlenecks and a matching must exist by Hall's Theorem. 
\end{solution}
