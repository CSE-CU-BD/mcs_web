\begin{problem}

Recall from class that, if application of procedure, $P$ to string $s$
results in a computation that eventually halts, we say that $P$
\emph{recognizes} $s$.  We define $\rcg{P}$ to be the set of
strings---the \emph{language}---recognized by $P$:
\[
\rcg{P} \eqdef \set{s \in \asciistr \suchthat P\ \text{recognizes}\ s}.
\]
Let
\[
\no-halt-00-11 \eqdef \set{s \in \asciistr \suchthat P_s\ \text{recognizes neither 00 nor 11}}.
\]

Prove that \no-halt-00-11 is not recognizable.

\begin{solution}
We show this by making a "reduction argument": that is, we show that
if there was one recognizer for Nohalts-$00$-$11$ then we could use
such recognizer to define another recognizer for No-halt, which we
already proved in class not to be recognizable.

We may define a procedure $P_{s'}$ that does the following: on input
$t$, ignore the input and simulate $P_s$ on $s$. This means that
$P_{s'}$ has the same effect regardless of input: in particular, if
$P_{s'}$ halts on any string then it means that $P_s$ halts when
applied on $s$. Specifically, if $P_{s'}$ halts on $11$ and on $00$,
then $P_s$ halts when applied on $s$.

This means that if we had a recognizer for Nohalts-$00$-$11$ then we
could use said recognizer to find out if $P_s$ halts when applied on
$s$ by checking if $s' \in $ Nohalts-$00$-$11$.

This completes the reduction and shows that there cannot be a
recognizer for Nohalts-$00$-$11$.
