\begin{problem}
Prove that a set, $R$, of real numbers is well ordered iff there is
no infinite sequence
\begin{equation}\label{s0s1dots}
r_0 > r_1 > r_2 > \dots 
\end{equation}
of elements $r_i \in R$.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
To prove the claim in one direction, suppose there was such an
infinite sequence~\eqref{s0s1dots}.  Then $R$ is not well ordered,
because the set of elements in the sequence would be a subset of $R$
with no minimum element.

Conversely, suppose $R$ is not well ordered.  Then it must have a
nonempty subset $S$ with no minimum element.  Then we can find an
infinite sequence~\eqref{s0s1dots} as follows.  Since $S$ is not
empty, there is an element $s_0 \in S$.  But since $S$ is has no
minimum element, there must be an element $s_1 \in S$ such that $s_0 >
s_1$.  Continuing in this way, we define
\[
s_{n+1} \eqdef \text{ an element of $S$ that is $> s_n$}
\]
for $n \geq 0$.
\end{proof}
\end{solution}

\iffalse
\footnote{The empty set is well ordered because an empty set has no
  nonempty subsets.  So by logical convention (see Section~\bref{}),
  any proposition about all of these nonexistent subsets is true.}
