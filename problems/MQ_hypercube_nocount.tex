\begin{problem}

The $n$-dimensional hypercube, $H_n$, is a simple graph whose vertices are the binary strings of length $n$. Two vertices are adjacent if and only if they differ in exactly 1 bit. For example, in $H_3$, vertices \texttt{111} and 
\texttt{011} are adjacent because they differ only in the first bit, while vertices \texttt{101} and \texttt{011} are not adjacent because they differ at both the first and second bits. \\
\\
Explain why it is impossible to find two spanning trees of $H_3$ that have no edges in common.
\examspace[3in]
\begin{solution}
$H_3$ has $2^3=8$ vertices, so any spanning tree must have $8-1=7$ edges. But $H_3$ has only $3(2^{3-1})=12$ edges, so any two sets of 7 edges must overlap.
\end{solution}
