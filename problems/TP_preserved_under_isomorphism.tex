\begin{problem}
Which of the items below are simple-graph properties preserved under
isomorphism?

\bparts

\ppart There is a cycle that includes all the vertices.

\begin{staffnotes}
If asked, explain that simple graph cycles can be defined in the
essentially same way as for digraphs.  The only difference is that going
back and forth on the same edge---a length 2 ``cycle''---is not
considered to be a cycle.
\end{staffnotes}

\ppart The vertices are numbered 1 through 7.

\ppart The vertices can be numbered 1 through 7.

\ppart There are two degree 8 vertices.

\ppart\label{eqlen} Two edges are of equal length.

\begin{staffnotes}
Not a property of simple graphs since edges don't have length.
\end{staffnotes}

%\ppart There are exacty two spanning trees.

\ppart No matter which edge is removed, there is a path between any two
  vertices.

\ppart There are two cycles that do not share any vertices. % too easy

%\ppart There are two connected components. % too easy

%\ppart\label{edgesubset} One edge is a subset of another one.

\ppart\label{vertexsubset} The vertices are distinct sets.

\begin{staffnotes}
If need be, remind students that we used sets as vertices when we
proved that every poset can be represented sets under containment.
\end{staffnotes}

\ppart The graph can be pictured in a way that all the edges have the same length.

\ppart No two edges cross.

%\ppart The graph is 4-colorable. % too easy

%\ppart Adding an edge between any two vertices creates a cycle. % spanning tree one better

\ppart\label{isoOR} The $\QOR$ of two properties that are preserved under isomorphism.

\begin{staffnotes}
When students have figured out that item~\eqref{isoOR} is in the
positive category, ask them to do a careful proof of that fact.  See
solution for an example.
\end{staffnotes}

\ppart The negation of a property that is preserved under isomorphism.

\eparts

\begin{solution}
Item~\eqref{eqlen} is not a property of simple graphs, since edges
don't have length.  

Item~\eqref{vertexsubset} is not preserved under isomorphism.
Although it can be useful to use sets as vertices\inbook{---as was
  done for representing DAGs in
  Theorem~\bref{thm:posetrepsets}---}\inhandout{,}vertices need not be
represented by sets.  Since isomorphism does not depend on what
vertices are made of, vertices being sets is not going to be
preserved.

\iffalse
Note that the version of~\eqref{vertexsubset} originally used in class
asked whether one \emph{edge} was a subset of another one.  Since an
edge in a simple graph is defined to be a set of size two, namely the
set consisting of its endpoints, and no set of size two can be a
subset of another subset of size two, the property in this version of
the problem was \emph{always false} and so was \emph{vacously
  preserved}.
\fi

All the others are preserved.  We'll prove this just for
item~\eqref{isoOR}:
\begin{proof}
Suppose $P$ and $Q$ are graph properties preserved under isomorphism,
and $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic simple graphs.  Let $R \eqdef P \QOR
Q$.  Then
\[\begin{array}{rcll}
R(G) 
  & \QIFF & P(G) \QOR Q(G)
     & \text{(def of $R$)}\\
  & \QIMPLIES & P(H) \QOR Q(H) 
     & \text{(since $P$, $Q$ are preserved)}\\
  & \QIFF & R(H)
     & \text{(def of $R$)},
\end{array}\]
so $R$ is preserved, as claimed.
\end{proof}
\end{solution}
