\begin{problem}
  There are four isomorphisms between these two graphs. List them.

\begin{figure}[h]
\graphic{iso_graphs_morning}
\end{figure}

\begin{solution}
These are the vertex correspondences for the four isomorphisms: \\
1A, 2B, 3C, 4D, 5E, 6F \\
1A, 2B, 3D, 4C, 5F, 6E \\
1B, 2A, 3C, 4D, 5E, 6F \\
1B, 2A, 3D, 4C, 5F, 6E

\medskip \\

Some simple reasoning leads us to this answer.  The first graph in this problem has exactly two nodes with degree 3 (nodes 3 and 4), as does the second graph ($c$ and $d$).  Recall that nodes related by an isomorphism must have equal degrees.  Thus, the isomorphism must map 3 to either $c$ or $d$, and it must map 4 to the other.  Independently of this choice, nodes 1, 2, $a$, and $b$ are the only nodes connected to exactly the degree-3 nodes, so the ismorphism must divide 1 and 2 between $a$ and $b$.  Node 5 is the only unassigned node connected to node 3, so 5 must be mapped to either $e$ or $f$, depending on which is adjacent to the counterpart of node 3; and now node 6 maps to whichever node is left.

\end{solution}
