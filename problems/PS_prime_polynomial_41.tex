\begin{problem}
  For $n=40$, the value of polynomial $p(n) \eqdef n^2+n+41$ % is not
  prime, as noted in Section~\bref{pred_sec}\inhandout{ of the Course
    Text}.  But we could have predicted based on general principles
  that no nonconstant polynomial can generate only prime numbers.

  In particular, let $q(n)$ be a nonconstant polynomial with integer
  coefficients, and let $c \eqdef q(0)$ be the constant term of $q$.

\begin{problemparts}
\ppart\label{qcnmulc} Verify that $q(cn)$ is a multiple of $c$ for all $n \in
\integers$.

\begin{solution}
Say $q(n) = c+ \sum_{i=1}^k c_in^i$.  Then $q(cn) = c(1+ \sum_{i=1}^{k} c_iin^{i}c^{i-1})$.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{consc>1} Show that if $c > 1$, then there are infinitely many $n \in
\naturals}$ such that $q(n)$ is not prime.

  \hint Assume the familiar fact that the magnitude (absolute value)
  of any nonconstant polynomial, $q(n)$, grows unboundedly as $n$
  grows.

\begin{solution}
  If $\abs{q(cm)} > c >1$, then $q(cm)$ won't be prime because by
  part~\eqref{qcnmulc}, it has $c$ as a factor.  Since $\abs{q(n)}$
  grows unboundedly, there will be infinitely many different values of
  $q(cm)$ as $m$ grows.
\end{solution}

\ppart Conclude immediately that there must be an $n \in \naturals$
such that $q(n)$ is not prime.

\begin{solution}
By part~\eqref{consc>1}, the only remaining case is when $c \leq 1$.
But in that case $q(n)$ is not prime for $n=0$.
\end{solution}

\end{problemparts}

\end{solution}
