\begin{problem}
A wheel-of-fortune has the numbers from $1$ to $2n$ arranged in a
circle.  The wheel has a spinner, and a spin randomly determines the
two numbers at the opposite ends of the spinner.  How would you
arrange the numbers on the wheel to maximize the expected value of\dots

\bparts
\ppart \dots the sum of the numbers chosen?  What is the max?

\begin{solution}
It makes no difference how you arrange the numbers, the expected value
is the same.  Why?  If we label the ends of the spinner we can define
$2$ random variables $X$ and $Y$.  $X$ is the number pointed to by one
end of the spinner and $Y$ is the other number.  We wish to maximize
$\expect{X+Y}$.  But since $\expect{X+Y} = \expect{X} + \expect{Y}$
and $\expect{X} = \expect{Y} = (2n+1)/2$, all arangements give the
same expected value of $2n+1$.
\end{solution}

\ppart \dots the product of the numbers chosen?  What is the max?

\hint Verify that the best way to do this is to ensure that successive
integers are opposite each other, that is, $1$ is opposite $2$, $3$ is
opposite 4, 5 is opposite 6, \dots.


\begin{solution}
We claim the best way to do this is to have each odd number $k$
opposite $k+1$ starting with $k=1$ up to $k = 2n-1$.  Let's call this
the \emph{successor arrangement}.  We'll show that any arrangement
that differs from the successor arrangement can be altered to have a
larger expected product.  This implies that the successor arrangement
must be the unique arrangement with maximum expected product.

Given any arrangement, let's say a number is OK if it is opposite the
same number as in the successor arrangement.  So in any arrangement,
opposite numbers are both OK or neither is OK.  Likewise, any other
arrangement, numbers that are opposite in the successor arrangement
are either both OK or neither is OK.

Now any given arrangement not equal to the successor arrangement must
have a smallest number, $k$, that is not OK.  Since $k$ is the
smallest number that is not OK, it must be oppposite some larger not
OK number $p$.  Also, $k$ must be odd, or else $k-1$ would be a
smaller number that is not OK.  Since $k$ is odd, it is opposite $k+1$
in the successor arrangement, and therefore $k+1$ in not OK and $p
\neq k+1$, which implies $p>k+1$.  This also means that $k+1$ is
opposite some $q$ that is also not OK.

Now create a new arrangement by putting $k$ opposite $k+1$ and $p$
opposite $q$, leaving all the other opposites unchanged.  The new
arrangement will have a larger expected product than the given one.

To prove this, note that since all pairs are equally likely when we
turn the spinner, it suffices to show that the sum of the products of
the switched numbers is larger in the second arrangement, that is,
that
\[
kp + (k+1)q < k(k+1)+pq.
\]
This holds iff
\[
k(k+1)+pq - (kp + (k+1)q) > 0.
\]
But the left hand term simplifies to $(k-q)(k-(p-1))$, which is
greater than zero since $k$ is smaller than both $q$ and $p-1$.

So the expected value of the product is 1/$n$th of
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1)2i = 4 \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 - 2 \sum_{i=1}^n i = 4 \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 2 \frac{n(n+1)}{2},
\]
namely\footnote{See Problem~\bref{sum-of-sq} for the sum-of-squares formula.},
\[
\frac{(n+1)(4n-1)}{3} = (4/3)n^2 + n - 1/3.
\]

\end{solution}
