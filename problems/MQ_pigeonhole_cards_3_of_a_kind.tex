\begin{problem}
In a standard 52-card deck, what is the smallest $k$ such that
every size $k$ subset of the 52 cards contains a 3-of-a-kind?
(3-of-a-kind is defined as 3 cards of the same rank).
Clearly indicate what are the pigeons, holes, and rules for assigning
a pigeon to a hole, and give the value of $k$.

\begin{solution}
\[
k = 27.
\]
%$27$.
The cards in the size $k$ subset are the pigeons, the 13 card ranks are the
pigeon holes and a pigeon is assigned to its rank. 
By the Generalized Pigeonhole Principle, we want the smallest integer $k$ such that
\[
\ceil{\frac{k}{13}} = 3,
\]
which is equivalent to
\[
\frac{k}{13} > 2.
\]
\end{solution}
