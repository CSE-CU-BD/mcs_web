\begin{problem}
In a standard 52-card deck, if you received them in a random order,
how many cards do you need to guarantee that you have a 3-of-a-Kind
(3 cards of the same rank)? Briefly explain your answer.

\begin{solution}
By the Pigeonhole Principle, there are 13 ranks (holes),
so $(13)(3-1)+1=27$ cards (pigeons) will guarantee that
at least 3 cards have the same rank.
\end{solution}
