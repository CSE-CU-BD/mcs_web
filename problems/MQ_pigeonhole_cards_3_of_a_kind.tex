\begin{problem}
In a standard 52-card deck, what is the smallest $k$ such that
every size $k$ subset of the 52 cards contains a 3-of-a-kind?
(3-of-a-kind is defined as 3 cards of the same rank).
Briefly explain your answer.

\begin{solution}
$27$.

There are 13 possible card ranks, so by the Generalized Pigeonhole
Principle, we want the smallest integer $k$ such that
\[
\ceil{\frac{k}{13}} = 3,
\]
which is equivalent to
\[
\frac{k}{13} > 2.
\]
\end{solution}
