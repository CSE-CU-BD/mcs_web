The figure above shows the structure of a 3-vertex walk graph.  Let
$p_{XY}$ be the probability of the edge $\diredge{X}{Y}$ for $X,Y \in
\set{A,B,C}$.  Let $a$ be the expected length of a random walk that
starts at vertex $A$ and reaches vertex $C$ for the first time.
Likewise, let $b$ be the expected length of a random walk that starts
at $B$ and reaches $C$ for the first time.  Write a system of linear
equations that can be solved to yield a simple expressions for $a$ and
$b$ in terms of $p_{XY}$'s for $X,Y \in \set{A,B,C}$.  You do
\emph{not} need to solve for $a$ or $b$.

\begin{solution}
Let $b$ be the expected length of a random walk that starts at $B$ and
reaches vertex $C$ for the first time.  Then by Conditional
Expectation we have

\begin{align*}
a & = p_{AC}\cdot 1 + p_{AB} \cdot (1 + b) + p_{AA}\cdot (1 + a)\\
b & = p_{BC}\cdot 1 + p_{BA} \cdot (1 + a) + p_{BB}\cdot (1 + b).
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
