\begin{problem}

\bparts

\ppart Color each point in the plane with integer coordinates either
red, white or blue.  Let $R$ be a $4 \times 82$ rectangular grid of
these points.  Explain why at least two of the 82 rows in $R$ must
have the same sequence colors.

\begin{solution}
There are only $3^4=81$ ways to color the points in a row of length 4,
and there are 82 rows, so by the Pigeonhole Principle, two rows must
be colored the same.
\end{solution}

\ppart Conclude that $R$ contains four points with the same color that
form the corners of a rectangle.

\begin{solution}
Since each length 4 row of $R$ is colored with only 3 colors, some
color, say red, must occur more than once in each of the two rows with
the same coloring.  The first two points colored red in each of these
two rows form a rectangle.
\end{solution}

\ppart Generalize the above argument to a coloring using the rainbow
colors Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet as well as
White and Black.

\begin{solution}
There are now 9 colors, so a row of 10 points will have a color
repeated, say red, and a rectangle with $9^{10} +1$ rows will have two
rows with matching colors, so again, the first two red points in each
of the matched rows will form a rectangle.
\end{solution}
