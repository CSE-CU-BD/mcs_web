What is the density function of $M$?\begin{solution}\begin{eqnarray*}\pdf_M(1) & = \frac{1}{27}\\\pdf_M(2) & = \frac{7}{27} \\\pdf_M(3) & = \frac{19}{27} \end{eqnarray*}This can be hashed out by counting the possible outcomes.  Alternatively,we can reason as follows:The event $M=1$ is the event that all three of the variables equal 1, andsince they are mutually independent, we have\[\pr{M=1}\ \ =\ \ \pr{X_1=1}\cdot \pr{X_2=1}\cdot \pr{X_3=1} =\paren{\frac{1}{3}}^3 = \frac{1}{27}.\]To compute $\pr{M=2}$, we first compute $\pr{M \leq 2}$.  Now the event$[M \leq 2]$ is the event that all three of the variables is at most 2, soby mutual independence we have\[\pr{M\leq 2}\ \ =\ \ \pr{X_1 \leq 2}\cdot \pr{X_2\leq 2}\cdot \pr{X_3 \leq 2} =\paren{\frac{2}{3}}^3 = \frac{8}{27}.\]Therefore,\[\pr{M=2}\ \ =\ \ \pr{M \leq 2} - \pr{M=1} = \frac{8}{27} - \frac{1}{27} =\frac{7}{27}.\]Finally,\[\pr{M=3}\ \ =\ \ 1- \pr{M\leq 2} = 1- \frac{8}{27} = \frac{19}{27}.\]\end{solution}\end{problem}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem ends here%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
