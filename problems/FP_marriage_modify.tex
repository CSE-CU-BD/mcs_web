\textbf{Stable Marriage}

Consider a \idx{stable marriage} problem with 4 boys and 4 girls. Here
are their preference rankings:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|c} 
Alfred:    & Helen, Emily, Fiona, Grace    \\
Billy:     & Emily, Grace, Fiona, Helen    \\
Calvin:    & Grace, Helen, Emily, Fiona    \\
David:     & Helen, Grace, Emily, Fiona
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|c} 
Emily:     & Alfred, Calvin, David,  Billy    \\
Fiona:     & Calvin, Billy,  Alfred, David    \\
Grace:     & Calvin, Alfred, David,  Billy    \\
Helen:     & Calvin, Billy,  David,  Alfred
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\bparts

\ppart
Exhibit a stable matching between the boys and girls.

\ppart
A machine is programmed to output 3 different matching randomly.
What is the probability that at least one is stable?

\ppart
Suppose that Calvin, being a noble and good friend of David, decides
to modify his preference ranking in order to help match David with 
Helen. Find a new preference ranking for Calvin such that any stable
matching will have David and Helen be a couple.
