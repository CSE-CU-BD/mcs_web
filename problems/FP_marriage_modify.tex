\begin{problem}

\textbf{Stable Marriage}

Consider a \idx{stable marriage} problem with 4 boys and 4 girls. Here
are their preference rankings:

% Modified slightly from MQ_stable_matching_unique_morning}
% Doesn't work yet!!! need to at least modify Calvin's prefs

\textit{Change names since it is too similar to the one from MQ}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|c} 
Alfred:    & Helen, Emily, Fiona, Grace    \\
Billy:     & Helen, Grace, Fiona, Emily    \\
Calvin:    & Grace, Helen, Emily, Fiona    \\
David:     & Helen, Grace, Emily, Fiona
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|c} 
Emily:     & Alfred, Calvin, David,  Billy    \\
Fiona:     & Calvin, Billy,  Alfred, David    \\
Grace:     & Calvin, Alfred, David,  Billy    \\
Helen:     & Calvin, Billy,  David,  Alfred
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\bparts

\ppart
Exhibit a stable matching between the boys and girls.

\begin{solution}
  (Alfred, Emily), (Billy, Helen), (Calvin, Grace), (David, Fiona)
\end{solution}

\ppart A machine is programmed to output three different matchings (not
necessarily stable) randomly.  What is the probability that at least one
of three is stable?

\begin{solution}
  There are $4!$ possible matchings, so there are $\binom{4!}{3} $ sets
  consisting of three matchings.   We know that the solution to part a
  is unique, so there is only one possible sequence out of the $4!$
  sequences that is stable.

  The total number of sets of three matchings that include one stable matching
  is therefore $\binom{4!-1}{2}$ (choose 2 unstable matching), so the
  probability is:
\[
\frac{\binom{4!-1}{2}}{\binom{4!}{3}} = \frac{1}{8}
\]
\end{solution}

\iffalse too much for a final

\ppart Suppose that Billy, being a noble and good friend of David, decides
to modify his preference ranking in order to help match David with Helen.
Find a new preference ranking for Billy such that any stable matching will
have David and Helen be a couple.  Explain why there is no other stable
matching with Helen being matched with someone else.

\begin{solution}
  Any ranking with Fiona in front of Helen will make it work.
\end{solution}
