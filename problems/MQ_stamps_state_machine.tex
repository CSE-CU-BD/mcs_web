\begin{problem}
  A student-made stamp vending machine that only sells 4 and 7 cent 
  stamps has a rather strange interface for selecting how many stamps
  to output. The user may choose to:
  
  % Let $a$ be the number of 3-cent stamps and $b$ be the number of 7-cent
  %   stamps. The user may choose to:
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)]  Add 1 4-cent stamps, or
    \item[(ii)] Remove 2 4-cent AND 2 7-cent stamps. (must have at least
    2 of each kind of stamps.)
  \end{enumerate}
  
  The machine always starts with 10 4-cent stamps and 5 7-cent stamps.

  Let $A$ be the number of 4-cent stamps; and $B$ be the number of 
  7-cent stamps. Identify the following derived variables:
  
  \[\begin{array}{| c | c | c | c | c | c | c |}
      \hline
      \text{derived variables:} & $A$ & $B$ & $4*A+7*B$ & $remainder(A/2)$ & $remainder(B/2)$ & $remainder((4*A+7*B)/2)$ \\ \hline
      \textbf{weakly increasing} & & & & & & \\ \hline
      \textbf{strictly increasing} & & & & & & \\ \hline
      \textbf{weakly decreasing} & & & & & & \\ \hline
      \textbf{strictly increasing} & & & & & & \\ \hline
      \textbf{constant} & & & & & & \\ \hline
      \hline
  \end{array}\]

  Circle the properties below that must be preserved invariants:
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The number of 7-cent stamps ($B$) must be even.
    \item The number of 7-cent stamps ($B$) must be greater than 0.
    \item The total cost of stamps ($4*A+7*B$) must be odd.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \begin{solution}
    TBA
  \end{solution}
  
  \ppart
  
  Using the Invariant Principle, show that it is impossible to output 
  stamps with a total value of exactly one dollar. (You may assume that 
  the properties you chose in part b are preserved invariants without 
  proof.)
