\begin{problem}
You have a biased coin with nonzero probability $p<1$ of tossing a
Head.  You toss until a Head comes up and record the number, $k$, of
Tails that preceded this first Head.  Then\inbook{, similar the
  example in Section~\bref{infinite_expect_sec},} you keep tossing
until you get another run of tails of nearly the same length, namely,
of length $\min\set{k-10,0}$.  Prove that the expected number of Heads
you toss is infinite.

\begin{solution}
Let the random variable $T$ be the length of your initial run of
tails.  If $T=k$, then the expected number of Heads tossed until
getting another run of Tails of length at least $k_{10} \eqdef
\min\set{k-10,0}$ will be the mean time to failure, where ``failing''
means tossing $k_{10}$ Tails.  Since the probability of failure is
$q^{k_{10}}$, where $q \eqdef 1-p$, this mean time is $1/q^{k_{10}}$.
Letting $H$ be the number of Heads tossed, we have
\begin{align*}
\expect{H}
    & = \sum_{k \in \naturals} \expcond{H}{T=k} \cdot \prob{T=k}\\
    & = \sum_{k \in \naturals} \frac{1}{q^{k_{10}}} \cdot q^k p\\
    & = \text{constant} + \sum_{k \geq 10}  \frac{1}{q^{k-10}} \cdot q^k p\\
    & = \text{constant} + p\sum_{k \geq 10} q^{10} = \infty.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}

\begin{editingnotes}
ppart We can formalize the process of sampling a random variable $T$
and then counting the number of repeat samples needed until we get a
value larger than the initial one as follows.  Let $T_1, T_2,\dots$ be
mutually independent random variables with the same distribution as
$T$ and define
\[
R \eqdef \min\set{k \geq 1 \suchthat T_k > T}.
\]
Suppose $\pdf_{T}(n) = \Theta(n^a)$ for some real number $a >1$.
Prove that $\expect{R} = \infty$.\footnote{You may not appeal to
  Problem~\bref{PS_infinite_repeat_expectation} which shows that for
  essentially \emph{every} random variable $T$, the corresponding
  repeat variable $R$ has infinite expectation.}
