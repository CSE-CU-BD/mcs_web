\begin{problem}
Start with 110 coins on a table, 10 showing heads and 100 showing tails.

There are two ways to change the coins:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] Remove $20$ coins from the table, $10$ of which must be 
  \emph{heads} and the other $10$ must be \emph{tails}, or
\item[(ii)] Let $n$ be the number of heads showing.  If there are 
  \emph{more tails than heads} on the table, place $n$ additional coins,
   all showing heads, on the table.
\end{enumerate}

\bparts

\ppart
Model this situation as a state machine, carefully defining the set of
states, the start state and the possible state transitions.

\textbf{Reminder}: be sure to state the conditions of the state
transitions.

\instatements{\vspace{1.5in}}

\ppart Let $H \eqdef \text{the number of heads}$ and $T \eqdef \text{the
  number of heads}$.  For each of the derived variables below, indicate
which property it satisfies.

The choices for properties are: \emph{constant}, \emph{strictly
increasing}, \emph{strictly decreasing}, \emph{weakly increasing but not constant},
\emph{weakly decreasing but not constant}, \emph{none of these}.
