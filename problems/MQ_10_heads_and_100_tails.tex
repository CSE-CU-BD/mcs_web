\begin{problem}
Start with 110 coins on a table, 10 showing heads and 100 showing tails.

There are two ways to change the coins:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] Remove $10$ \emph{heads} and $10$ \emph{tails}.

\item[(ii)] If there are \emph{more tails than heads} on the table, add
  more heads so the number of heads is doubled.
\end{enumerate}

\bparts

\ppart
Model this situation as a state machine, carefully defining the set of
states, the start state and the possible state transitions.

\textbf{Reminder}: be sure to state the conditions of the state
transitions.

\examspace{1.5in}

\ppart Let $H \eqdef \text{the number of heads}$ and $T \eqdef \text{the
  number of heads}$.  For each of the derived variables below, indicate
which property it satisfies.

The choices for properties are: \textbf{SI}: Strictly Increasing;
\textbf{SD}: Strictly Decreasing; \textbf{WI}: Weakly Increasing but not
constant; \textbf{WD}: Weakly Decreasing but not constant; \textbf{C}:
Constant; \textbf{N}: None of these.
