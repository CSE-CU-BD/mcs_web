\begin{problem}
	
  A recent Gallup poll found that 35\% of the adult population of the
  United States believes that the theory of evolution is ``well-supported
  by the evidence.''  Gallup polled $1928$ Americans selected uniformly
  and independently at random.  Of these, $675$ asserted belief in
  evolution, leading to Gallup's estimate that the fraction of Americans
  who believe in evolution is $675/1928 \approx 0.350$.  Gallup claims a
  margin of error of 3 percentage points, that is, he claims to be
  confident that his estimate is within 0.03 of the actual percentage.

\ppart\label{varindicator} What is the largest variance an indicator
variable can have?

\begin{solution}
\[
\frac{1}{4}
\]

By Lemma~\bref{bernoulli-variance}, $\variance{H} = pq$.  Here's a proof
starting from the definition of variance:
\begin{align*}
\variance{H}
     & = \expect{(H-p)^2}
                   & \text{(def of $\variance{}$)}\\
     & = \expect{H^2-2pH+p^2}\\
     & = \expectsq{H} - 2p\expect{H} + p^2
                   & \text{(linearity of $\expect{}$)}\\
     & = p - p^2   & \text{(since $\expect{H} =p$ and $H^2 = H$)}\\
     & = pq        & (q \eqdef 1-p).
\end{align*}

Noting that $d\, p(1-p)/dp = 2p-1$ is zero when $p=1/2$, it follows that
the maximum value of $p(1-p)$ must be at $p = 1/2$, so the maximum value
f $\variance{H}$ is $(1/2)(1 -(1/2)) = 1/4$.
\end{solution}

\iffalse
\ppart What is the variance of a binomial variable, $B_{n,p}$?
\[
B_{n,p} = H_1 + H_2 + \cdots + H_n
\]
where the $H_i$'s are mutually independent indicator variables with
$\pr{H_i=1} = p$, and by independence and part~\eqref{varindicator},
\[
\variance{H_1 + H_2 + \cdots + H_n} = \variance{H_1} + \variance{H_2} + \cdots +
\variance{H_n} = npq.
\]
\fi

\ppart Use the Pairwise Independent Sampling Theorem to determine a
confidence level with which Gallup can make his claim.

\begin{solution}
By the Pairwise Independent Sampling, the probability that a sample of
size $n=1928$ is further than $x = 0.03$ of the actual fraction is at most
\[
\paren{\frac{\sigma}{x}}^2 \cdot \frac{1}{n}
\leq \paren{\frac{1}{4(0.03)^2}\cdot 1928} \leq 0.144
\]
so we can be confident of Gallup's estimate at the 85.6\% level.
\end{solution}

\ppart Gallup actually claims greater than 99\% confidence in his
estimate.  How might he have arrived at this conclusion?  (Just explain
what quantity he could calculate; you do not need to carry out a
calculation.)

\begin{solution}
Gallup's sample has a binomial distribution $B_{1928,p}$ for an
unknown $p$ he estimates to be about $0.35$.  So he wants an upper bound on
\[
\pr{\abs{\frac{B_{1928,p}}{1928} - p} > 0.03}
\]
By part~\eqref{varindicator}, the variance of $B_{n,p}$ is largest when $p
=1/2$, which suggests that the probability that a sample average differs
from the actual mean will be largest when $p=1/2$.  This is in fact the
case.  So Gallup will calculate
\begin{align*}
\pr{\abs{\frac{B_{1928,1/2}}{1928} - \frac{1}{2}} > 0.03}
    & = \pr{\abs{B_{1928,1/2} - \frac{1928}{2}} > 0.03(1928)}\\
    & = \pr{906 \leq B_{1928,1/2} \leq 1021}
    & = \frac{\sum_{i=906}^{1021} \binom{1928}{i}}{2^{1928}}
    & \approx 0.9912.
\end{align*}
\emph{Mathematica} will actually calculate this sum exactly, but there are
many much more efficient ways to get a good estmate of this value.

\end{solution}

\ppart Accepting the accuracy of all of Gallup's polling data and
calculations, can you conclude that there is a high probability that the
number of adult Americans who believe in evolution is $35 \pm 3$ percent?

\begin{solution}
No.  As explained in Notes and lecture, the assertion that
fraction $p$ is in the range $0.35\pm 0.03$ is an assertion of fact that
is either true or false.  The number $p$ is a \emph{constant}.  We
don't know its value, and we don't know if the asserted fact is true or
false, but there is nothing probabilistic about the fact's truth or
falsehood.

We \textit{can} say that either the assertion is true or else a 1-in-100
event occurred during the poll.  Specifically, the unlikely event is
that Gallup's random sample was unrepresentative.  This may convince you
that $p$ is ``probably'' in the range $0.35 \pm 0.03$, but this informal
``probably'' is not a mathematical probability.
\end{solution}
