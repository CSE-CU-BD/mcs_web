\begin{problem}
% Tests understanding of gcd and modular arithmetic

\begin{problemparts}

\problempart\label{valphi100}
Calculate the value of $\phi(100)$.
\examspace[3in]

\begin{solution}
\[
\phi(100) = \phi(25) \phi(4) = \phi(5^2) \phi(2^2) =  (5^2 - 5)(2^2 - 2) = 40.
\]
\end{solution}


\ppart\label{k121k100} Conclude that
\[
k^{121} \equiv k \pmod{100}
\]
when $\gcd(k,100) =1$.

%\hint Use your solution to part (\ref{phi}).

\begin{solution}
\begin{align*}
k^{121} & = k \cdot (k^{40})^3\\
       & = k \cdot (k^{\phi(100)})^3 & \text{(by part~\eqref{valphi100})}\\
       & \equiv k \cdot (1)^3 \pmod{100} & \text{(when $\gcd(k,100) =1$ by Euler's Theorem)}\\
       & = k.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}

\problempart Conclude that the last two digits of the decimal
representations of $k$ and $k^{121}$ are the same for any integer $k >
9$ that is relatively prime to 100.

\begin{solution}
The last two digits of the decimal representations of a two positive
integers are the same iff they are congruent modulo 100.   So this
part follows immediately from part~\eqref{k121k100}.
\end{solution}
