\begin{problem}
Let $T$ be a positive integer valued random variable such that
\[
\pdf_T(n)  = \frac{1}{an^2},
\]
where
\[
a \eqdef \sum_{n \in \integers^+} \frac{1}{n^2}.
\]

Prove that $\expect{T}$ is infinite.

\begin{solution}
\begin{align*}
\expect{T}
     & \eqdef \sum_{n \in \integers^{+}} n \pdf_T(n)\\
     & = \sum_{n \in \integers^{+}} n\frac{1}{an^2}\\
     & = \sum_{n \in \integers^{+}} \frac{1}{an}\\
     & = \frac{1}{a} \lim_{n \in \integers^+} \cdot H_n = \infty.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}

\ppart Prove that $\expect{\sqrt{T}}$ is finite.

\begin{solution}
	
\begin{align*}
\expect{\sqrt{T}} & = \sum_{n \in \integers^{+}} \sqrt{n} \cdot \frac{1}{an^2}\\
    & = \sum_{n \in \integers^{+}} \frac{1}{an^{3/2}} < \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} = 
\frac{2}{3a}.
\end{align*}
