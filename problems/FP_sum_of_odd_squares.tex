\begin{problem}
We are interesed in finding a closed form formula for the sum
\begin{equation}\label{sumoddsq}
\sum_0^n (2n+1)^2.
\end{equation}
Describe one way (there are several) to obtain such a formula; you do
not actually have to find the closed form.  Alternatively, just
display any such formula for~\eqref{sumoddsq}.

As in Section~\bref{sec:sum_powers}, we can (correctly) guess that a
formula for~\ref{sumoddsq} will be a cubic polynomial
\[
an^3 + bn^2 + cn + d.
\]
Then we can determine the parameters $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ by
plugging in a few values for $n$ until we get enough equations in
$a,b,c,d$ to solve for their values.  Applying this method to our
example gives:
\begin{align*}
n = 0 & \qimplies  1 = d \\
n = 1 & \qimplies  10 = a + b + c + d \\
n = 2 & \qimplies  35 = 8a + 4b + 2c + d \\
n = 3 & \qimplies  84 = 27a + 9b + 3c + d.
\end{align*}
Solving this system gives the solution $a = 4/3, b = 4, c = 11/3, d = 1$
So the closed form formula for~\eqref{sumoddsq} would be
\[
\frac{4n^3 + 12n^2 + 11n + 3}{3}.
\]
Of course this remains a gues until we have verified it some how, for
exmaple using an induction proof.

Another approach is to rewrite $(2n+1)^2$ as $4n^2+4n +1$ and then find
\[

\]
