\begin{problem}
In this problem, structural induction and the Foundation Axiom of set theory provide simple
proofs about some utterly infinite objects.

\begin{definition*}
The class of `recursive set-like'' objects, \recset, is defined recursively as follows:

\inductioncase{Base case}: The empty set $\emptyset$ is a \recset.

\inductioncase{Constructor step}: If $S$ is a nonempty set of
\recset's, then $S$ is a \recset.
\end{definition*}

\bparts

\ppart Prove that \recset\ satisfies the Foundation Axiom: there is no
infinite sequence of \recset, $r_o,r_1,\dots,r_{n-1}, r_n,\dots$ such
that
\begin{equation}\label{indecr}
\dots r_n \in r_{n-1} \in \dots r_1 \in r_0.
\end{equation}

\hint Structural induction.

\begin{solution}
We prove by structural induction on the definition of \recset, that no
\recset $R$ can be the start $r_0$ of an infinite decreasing
sequence of members shown in~\eqref{indecr}.

\inductioncase{Base case}: ($R = \emptyset$).  $R$ cannot be $r_0$
because there is no $r_1$.

\inductioncase{Constructor step}: ($R$ is a nonempty set of \recset's).

If $R=r_0$ then $r_1 \in R$, and by structural induction hypothesis,
$r_1$ cannot be the start of an infinite decreasing sequence of
members, so neither can $R$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Prove that \emph{every} \emph{pure} set is a \recset.\footnote{A
  ``pure'' set is empty or is a set whose elements are all pure sets.}

\hint Use the Foundation axiom.

\begin{solution}
If there was a pure set that was not a \recset, then by Foundation
there would be a member-minimal set $S \notin \recset$.  By
minimality, every member of $S$ is a member of \recset, and therefore
by the constructor step, the set $S$ itself is a \recset, a
contradiction.
\end{solution}

\ppart Every \recset\ $R$ defines a special kind of two-person game of
perfect information called a \emph{uniform} game.  The initial ``board
position'' of the game is $R$ itself.  A player's move consists of
choosing any member $R$.  The two players alternate moves, with the
player whose turn it is to move called the \emph{Next} player.  The
Next player's move determines a game in which the other player, called
the \emph{Previous} player, moves first.

The game is called ``uniform'' because the two players have the
\emph{same} objective: to leave the other player stuck with no move to
make.  That is, whoever moves to the empty set is a winner, because
then the next player has no move.

Prove that in every uniform game, either the Previous player or the
Next player has a winning strategy.

\begin{solution}
Call a \recset\ a \emph{P-game} if the Previous player has a winning
strategy and an \emph{N-game} if the Next player has a winning
strategy.  We prove that every \recset $R$ is a P-game or and
N-game, by structural induction on the definition of \recset.

\inductioncase{Base case} ($R = \emptyset$): $R$ is an P-game since
the Next player cannot move.

\inductioncase{Constructor step}: ($R$ is a nonempty set of
\recset's): By structural induction, we may assume that every $s \in
R$ is a P-Game or an N-game.  If there is an $s \in R$ that is a
P-Game, then the Next player wins by picking $s$ (since he will be the
Previous player in $s$), and following the P-winning strategy in $s$.
This makes $R$ an N-game.

Otherwise, every $s \in R$ is an N-game, and the Previous player will
have a winning strategy to follow regardless of which game the Next
player selects.  This makes $R$ a P-game.
\end{solution}
