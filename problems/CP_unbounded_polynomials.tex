\begin{problem}
We took for granted in Problem~\ref{PS_prime_polynomial_41} that the
magnitude of a nonconstant polynomial grows unboundedly.  This follows
immediately from properties of big-Oh.

\begin{problemparts}

\ppart Prove that if $p(n)$ is a nonconstant polynomial, then $n = O(\abs{p(n)})$.

\begin{solution}
TBA
\end{solution}

\ppart Conclude that if $p(n)$ is a nonconstant polynomial, then
$p(\naturals)$ is an infinite set.

\begin{solution}
TBA
\end{solution}

\end{problemparts}
