\begin{problem}
Consider a stable marriage problem with 4 boys and 4 girls. It is
found that both of the following matchings will be stable:

\center (Alfred, Emily), (Billy, Fiona), (Calvin, Grace), (David, Helen)
\\* (Alfred, Fiona), (Billy, Emily), (Calvin, Helen), (David, Grace)

Suppose we already know the preference rankings of the following people:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|c} 
Alfred:  & Helen, Grace, Fiona, Emily \\
Billy:  & Helen, Grace, Emily, Fiona \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|c} 
Emily:  & David, Calvin, Alfred, Billy \\
Fiona:  & David, Calvin, Billy, Alfred \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
