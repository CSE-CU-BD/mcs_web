\begin{problem}
Recall the stable marriage problem from class.

\bparts

\ppart Specify the preference rankings for $21$ boys and $21$ girls such that
there is only one possible stable matching.  Justify your answer.

\begin{solution}
For each boy $b$, let $b$'s favorite girl $g$ prefer $b$ over all
other boys (all other rankings can be assigned arbitrarily). The
stable matching would be to match each boy with his favorite girl. For
any matching in which some boy $b$ is NOT matched with his favorite
girl $g$, we know $g$ prefers $b$ over her husband and $b$ prefers $g$
over his wife, so the matching is unstable because $b$ and $g$ form a
rogue couple.
\end{solution}

\ppart Mark each of the following predicates about the Stable Marriage
Ritual \textbf{P} if it is a \textbf{P}reserved Invariant, and
\textbf{N} if it is \textbf{n}ot.  (Do \textbf{not} include any
explanations.)
