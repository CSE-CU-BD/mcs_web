\begin{problemparts} 

\ppart\label{mqeswn} Indicate which of the following asymptotic
relations below on the set of nonnegative real-valued functions are
equivalence relations, (\textbf{E}), strict partial orders
(\textbf{S}), weak partial orders (\textbf{W}), or \emph{none} of the
above (\textbf{N}).

\begin{itemize}

\item $f=o(g)$, the ``little Oh'' relation. \hfill \examrule

\begin{solution}
\textbf{S}
\end{solution}

\item $f=O(g)$, the ``big Oh'' relation. \hfill \examrule

\begin{solution}
\textbf{N} because it is neither symmetric nor antisymmetric.
\end{solution}


\item $f = g \QOR [f=O(g) \QAND \QNOT(g=O(f))]$. \hfill \examrule

\begin{solution}
\textbf{W}.
\end{solution}

\item $f \sim g$, the ``asymptotically equal'' relation. \hfill \examrule
\begin{solution}
\textbf{E}
\end{solution}

\item $f=\Theta(g)$, the ``Theta'' relation. \hfill \examrule

\begin{solution}
\textbf{E}.
\end{solution}

\end{itemize}

\ppart Indicate the implications among the assertions in
part~\eqref{mqeswn}.

f\sim g & \QIMPLIES f = \Theta(g)\ \QIMPLIES\ f= O(g),\\
f = o(g) & \QIMPLIES\ f=O(g) \QAND \QNOT(g=O(f)) \QIMPLIES\ f= O(g)

Let
\[
f(n) \eqdef  n^n, \qquad g(n) \eqdef \begin{cases}
                                     n^{n-(1/2)} & \text{if $n$ is odd},\\
                                     n^{n+(1/2)} & \text{if $n$ is even}.
                                    \end{cases}
\]
Verify that $f \neq O(g)$ and $g \neq O(f)$.
