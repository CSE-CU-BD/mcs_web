\begin{problem}
  An $n$-bit $\QAND$-circuit has 0-1 valued inputs $a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{n-1}$ and
  one output $c$ whose value will be 
   \[
   c = a_0 \QAND a_2 \QAND \cdots \QAND a_{n-1}.
   \]

  There are various ways to design an $n$-bit $\QAND$-circuit.  A
  \emph{serial} design is simply a series of $\QAND$-gates, each with
  one input being a circuit input $a_i$ and the other input being the
  output of the previous gate as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:serial-AND}.

\end{figure}

  We can also use a \emph{tree} design.  A 1-bit tree design is just a
  wire, that is $c \eqdef a_1$.  Assuming for simplicity that $n$ is a
  power of two, an $n$-input tree circuit for $n>1$ simply consists of
  two $n/2$-input tree circuits whose outputs are $\QAND$'d to produce
  output $c$, as in Figures~\ref{fig:AND-tree-n}.  For example, a
  4-bit tree design circut is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:AND-tree-4}.

\ppart How many $\QAND$-gates are in the $n$-input serial
circuit?\examrule[0.7in]

\begin{solution}
$n-1$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Briefly explain why the tree circuit is \emph{exponentially
  faster} than the serial circuit.

\examspace[2in]

\begin{solution}
The ``speed'' or \emph{latency} of a circuit is the largest number of
gates on any path from an input to an output.  For the $n$-input
serial circuit, the longest such path is from $a_1$ to $c$, and it has
$n-1$ $\QAND$-gates.  FOr the $n$-input tree circuit, the length of
every path from an input to output $c$ is $\log_2 n - 1$, which is
exponentially smaller than $n$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Prove \inhandout{using the Well Ordering Principle} that the
$n$-input tree circuit has $n-1$ $\QAND$-gates.
 
\examspace[5in]

\begin{solution}
Suppose some $n$-bit tree circuit had a different number of
$\QAND$-gates.  By WOP, there is a least $m$ such that $m$ is a power
of two and the $m$-bit tree circuit does not have $m-1$ gates.

Since the 1-bit tree circuit has $0= 1-1$, so $m$ must be $>1$, and
since $m$ is a power of two, it must be divisible by 2.  So $m/2$ is a
smaller power of 2, and so an $m/2$-input tree circuit must have
$m/2-1$ $\QAND$-gates.  But since the $m$-input tree is made out of
two $m/2$-input trees, it has $(m/2-1)+(m/2-1)+1 = m-1$ $\QAND$-gates,
contradicting the assumption that the $m$-input tree has a different
number of gates.  This contradiction implies that the $n$-bit tree
circuit has $n-1$ gates for every $n$ that is a power of 2.

Serial is described by
   the formulas:
   \begin{align*}
     c_1     & \eqdef a_1 \QAND\ a_0\\
     c_2     & \eqdef a_2 \QAND\ c_1\\
     c_3     & \eqdef a_3 \QAND\ c_2\\
             & \vdots\\
     c_{n-1}  & \eqdef a_{n-1} \QAND\ c_{n-2}\\
     c       & \eqdef c_{n-1}.
\end{align*}


  The tree design is
  described by formulas involving binary variables $t_y$ where
  $y$ ranges over binary strings of length $\leq k$.  Any such
  positive length string $y$ is a binary representation of a
  nonnegative integer $\binnum{y}$ less than $n$.  For example,
\[
  \binnumt{00001} = 1, \quad \binnumt{010} = 2, \quad \binnumt{11} =
  3, \binnumt{110} = 6, \quad \binnumt{0111} = 7.
\]

  We begin by defining
  \[
  t_y \eqdef a_{\binnum{y}} \text{   (for $y$ of length $k$)}.
  \]
  For $y$ of length less than $k$, define
  \[
   t_{y} \eqdef t_{y\mtt{0}} \QAND\ t_{y\mtt{1}}
   \]
   So
  \begin{align*}
   t_{\lambda} & \eqdef t_{\mtt{0}} \QAND\ t_{\mtt{1}}\\
   t_{0} & \eqdef t_{\mtt{00}} \QAND\ t_{\mtt{01}}\\
   t_{1} & \eqdef t_{\mtt{10}} \QAND\ t_{\mtt{11}}\\
   t_{00} & \eqdef t_{\mtt{000}} \QAND\ t_{\mtt{001}}\\
        & \vdots
  \end{align*}
  Finally, the output $c$ is
  \[
  c  \eqdef t_{\lambda}.
   \]
