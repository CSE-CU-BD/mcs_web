\begin{problem}
There is a robot that steps between integer positions in 3-dimensional
space.  Each step of the robot increments one coordinate and leaves the
other two unchanged.
How many paths can the robot follow going from the origin
$(1,1,1)$ to $(3,4,5)$?

\begin{solution}
\[
\binom{(3-1)+(4-1)+(5-1)}{(3-1),(4-1),(5-1)} = \binom{9}{2,3,4}
\]
\end{solution}
