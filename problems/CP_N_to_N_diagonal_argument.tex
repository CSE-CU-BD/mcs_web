\begin{problem}
\begin{problem}
  Let $[\naturals\to \naturals]$ be the set of infinite sequences
of nonnegative integers.  For example, some sequences of
  this kind are:
\begin{align*}
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots),\\
(2, 3, 5, 7, 11,\dots),\\
(3, 1, 4, 5, 9, \dots).
\end{align*}
Prove that this set of sequences is\idx{uncountable}.

\begin{solution}
  
\begin{proof}
One approach is to show that if $[\naturals\to \naturals]$ were
countable, then $\power(\naturals)$ would be too, contradicting
Cantor's Theorem~\bref{powbig}.

Namely, we can define a surjective function from
$f:[\naturals\to \naturals] \to \power(\naturals)$ as follows:
\[
f(s) \eqdef \set{n \in \naturals \suchthat s[n] = 0}
\]
where $s[n]$ is the $n$th element of sequence $s$.

Now if there was a surjective function from $g: \naturals \to
[\naturals\to \naturals]$, then the composition of $f$ and $g$ would
be a surjective function from $\naturals$ to $\power(\naturals)$
contradicting Cantor's Theorem~\bref{powbig}.
\end{proof}

Alternatively, to show that $[\naturals \to \naturals]$ is
uncountable, we can use a basic diagonal argument directly to show
that no function from $\naturals$ to the set of sequences $[\naturals
  \to \naturals]$ is a surjection.

\begin{proof}
Let $\sigma$ be a function from $\naturals$ to the infinite sequences
of nonnegative integers.  To show that $\sigma$ is not a surjection,
we will describe a sequence, diag, of nonnegative integers that is not
in the range of $\sigma$.

Namely, define a sequence $\text{diag} \in [\naturals \to \naturals]$
as follows:
\[
\text{diag}[n] \eqdef \sigma(n)[n]+1.
\]
Now by definition,
\[
\text{diag}[n] \neq \sigma(n)[n],
\]
for all $n \in \naturals$, proving that diag is not equal to
$\sigma(n)$ for any $n \in \naturals$.  This means that diag is not in
the range of $\sigma$, as claimed.
\end{proof}
 
\end{solution}
