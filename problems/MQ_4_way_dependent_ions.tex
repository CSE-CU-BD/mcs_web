\begin{problem}
Suppose there are 4 ions in a crystal, laid out in the corners of a square
with corners $1$, $2$, $3$ and $4$. \iffalse
 as in Figure~\ref{fig:4desks}.

\begin{figure}

%\graphic{4_rectangles}

\caption{Arrangement of four ions.}

\label{fig:4desks}

\end{figure}\fi
Each corner is occupied by a sodium ion with probability $p>0$ or a chloride ion
with probability $q \eqdef 1-p > 0$.  A sodium ion and a chloride ion \emph{bond}
when they occupy adjacent corners of the square.  Let
$I_{12},I_{23},I_{34},I_{41}$ be the indicator variables that there is a
bonded pair at the indicated adjacent locations.

\bparts

\ppart Show that if $p = q$ then the events $I_{12} = 1$ and $I_{23} =
1$ are independent.
\examspace[2in]

\begin{solution}
If $p = q = 1/2$ then $\pr{I_{12} = 1} = \pr{I_{23} = 1} = 1/2$ and
$\pr{I_{12} = 1 \QAND\ I_{23} = 1}$ can be calculated from the fact that
only C-S-C and S-C-S are possible when both pairs are bonded.  In
that case, we have $\pr{I_{12} = 1 \QAND\ I_{23} = 1} = 2/8 = 1/4 =
\pr{I_{12} = 1} \cdot \pr{I_{12} = 1}$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Show rigorously that if the events $I_{12} = 1$ and $I_{23} =
1$ are independent then $p = q$. Hint: work from the definition of
independence, set up an equation and solve.
\examspace[4in]

\begin{solution}
We can again compare $\pr{I_{12} = 1 \QAND\ I_{23} = 1}$ and $\pr{I_{12}
  = 1}\cdot \pr{I_{23} = 1}$.

As in the previous part, $I_{12} = 1 \QAND\ I_{23} = 1$ only happen when
we have a pattern of C-S-C or S-C-S for ions 1 2 and 3
respectively. These occur with total probablity $p^2q + pq^2$. On the
other hand, $I_{12}$ happens with probability $2pq$ total, accounting
for the two patterns possible, S-C and C-S. Hence, $I_{12}$ and
$I_{23}$ are independent iff $p^2q + pq^2 = pq(p+q) = 4p^2q^2$. By
manipulating the expression we get $p+q = 4pq$. Recall $p+q =
1$. Hence, we are dealing with $1 = 4p - 4p^2$.  The equation can be
factored into $(2p - 1)^2 = 0$, yielding $p = 1/2$.
\end{solution}

\ppart What is the expected number of bonded pairs in terms of $p$ and $q$?
\examspace[1in]

\begin{solution}
The expected number of pairs is $8pq$ by linearity of expectation.
\end{solution}

\iffalse
\ppart What is the probability distribution function for the random variable $N$, the number
of bonded pairs?
\begin{solution}
$p_N(0) = 2/16, p_N(1) = 0 p_N(2) = 12/16, p_N(3) = 0, p_N(4) = 2/16$
\end{solution}
