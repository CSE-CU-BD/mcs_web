\begin{problem}
What's going on here?!

\[
1 = \sqrt{1} = \sqrt{(-1)(-1)} = \sqrt{-1} \sqrt{-1} = \paren{\sqrt{-1}}2 = -1.
\]

\begin{problemparts} 

\ppart Precisely identify and explain the mistake(s) in this
\emph{bogus} proof.

\begin{solution}


\end{solution}

\ppart Prove (correctly) that if $1=-1$, then $1=0$.

\begin{solution}
\begin{align*}
1          & =-1,\\
\frac{1}{2}& = - \frac{1}{2}, & \text{multiply both sides by $\frac{1}{2}$}\\
1=         & = 0             & \text{add $\frac{1}{2}$ to  both sides}.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
