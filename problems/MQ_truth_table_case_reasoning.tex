\begin{problem}

Show that there are exactly two truth assignments for the variables P,Q,R,S that satisfy the following formula:

\[ (\overline P \mbox{ OR } Q) \mbox{ AND } (\overline Q \mbox{ OR } R) \mbox{ AND } (\overline R  \mbox{ OR } S ) \mbox{ AND } (\overline S \mbox{ OR } P) \]

\hint A truth table will do the job, but it will have a bunch of rows.  A proof by cases can be quicker; if you do use cases,
be sure each one is clearly specified.

\begin{solution}
The two satisfying assignments are: all false or all true. You can plug them into the formula to check they satisfy it.

Proof by cases: assume $P$ is true, and with that show everyone else must be true. 
Then show if $P$ is false, everyone else is also false.

\end{solution}

%\begin{problem}
%Consider the following formula:

%The two satisfying assignments are: all false or all true. You can plug them into the formula to check they satisfy it.
%\end{solution}

%\ppart Explain \emph{briefly} why those are the only two satisfying assignments. Be as clear as you can, while remaining brief.

%\begin{solution}
%You can prove this by cases: assume $P$ is true, and with that show everyone else must be true. 
%Then show if $P$ is false, everyone else is also false.
