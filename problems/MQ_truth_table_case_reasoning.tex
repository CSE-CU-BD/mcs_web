\begin{problem}
Consider the following formula:

\[ (\overline P \mbox{ OR } Q) \mbox{ AND } (\overline Q \mbox{ OR } R) \mbox{ AND } (\overline R  \mbox{ OR } S ) \mbox{ AND } (\overline S \mbox{ OR } P) \]

\bparts

\ppart Exhibit two truth assignments (that is, truth environments) under which the formula evaluates to True.

\examspace[3in]

\begin{solution}
The two satisfying assignments are: all false or all true. You can plug them into the formula to check they satisfy it.
\end{solution}

\ppart Explain \emph{briefly} why those are the only two satisfying assignments. Be as clear as you can, while remaining brief.

\begin{solution}
You can prove this by cases: assume $P$ is true, and with that show everyone else must be true. 
Then show if $P$ is false, everyone else is also false.
\end{solution}
