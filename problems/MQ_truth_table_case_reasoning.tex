\begin{problem}

Show that there are exactly two truth assignments for the variables P,Q,R,S that satisfy the following formula:

\[
(\bar{P} \QOR\ Q) \QAND\ (\bar{Q} \QOR\ R) \QAND\ (\bar{R}  \QOR\ S ) \QAND\ (\bar{S} \QOR\ P)
\]

\hint A truth table will do the job, but it will have a bunch of rows.
A proof by cases can be quicker; if you do use cases, be sure each one
is clearly specified.

\begin{solution}
You can deduce the  only two possibilities by cases: 

If $P$ is false, then in order to have any chance of satisfying clause
4, $S$ must be false.  Similarly, if $S$ is false, then in order to
satisfy clause 3, $R$ must be false. And similarly, $Q$ must be
false. On the other hand, if $P$ is true, then $Q$ must be true to
make clause 1 true and have any chances of making the overall
expression true.  Similarly, if $Q$ is true, then $R$ must be true and
if $R$ is true then $S$ is true.

Those arguments prove there are at most 2 cases, but you need to show
the assignments we are left with actually satisfy the formula.  This
can be easily done, by plugging the values into the formula:

If all variables are set to true, then since clause 1 has $Q$ clause 2
has $R$, clause 3 has $S$, and clause 4 has $P$, then every clause is
satisfied, and the full $\mbox{AND}$ is satisfied.  If all are false,
then since clause 1 has $\bar P$, clause 2 has $\bar Q$ ,
clause 3 has $\bar R$ and clause 4 has $\bar S$, then again
every clause is satisfied and the overall proposition is satisfied. So
both of those satisfy the proposition.

%\ppart Exhibit two truth assignments (that is, truth environments) under which the formula evaluates to True.

%\begin{solution}
%The two satisfying assignments are: all false or all true. You can plug them into the formula to check they satisfy it.
%\end{solution}

%\ppart Explain \emph{briefly} why those are the only two satisfying assignments. Be as clear as you can, while remaining brief.

%\begin{solution}
%You can prove this by cases: assume $P$ is true, and with that show everyone else must be true. 
%Then show if $P$ is false, everyone else is also false.
