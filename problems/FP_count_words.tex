\begin{problem}
Let $a$ be the probability that a random permutation of the successive
letters in the word `TOOHOTTOHOOT' leaves the word unchanged.  Express
$a$ as a quotient of multinomial coefficient and a factorial.

\begin{solution}
There are $12!$ permutations of the 12 letters.  There are $6!$ perms of O's, $4!$ perms of T's and 2 perms of H's, so the probability is
\[
\frac{6!\, 4!\, 2}{12!}.
\]
Alternatively, there are
\[
\binom{12}{6, 4, 2}
\]
distinguishable permutations of the 12 letters.  Each is equally
likely and only one is the original `TOOHOTTOHOOT,' so the probability is
\[
\frac{1}{\binom{12}{6, 4, 2}}
\]

\end{solution}
