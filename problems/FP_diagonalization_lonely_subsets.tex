\begin{problem}
  Call a subset of the nonnegative integers \nngint\ is \emph{lonely}
  if it doesn't contain any pair of consecutive integers.  For
  example, the set $\set{1,5,25,125,\dots}$ of powers of $5$ is
  lonely, but the set of primes $\set{2,3,5,7,11,\dots}$ is not lonely
  because it contains both $2$ and $3$.

  Let $L$ be the set of lonely subsets of $\nngint$.  Show that $L$ is
  uncountable.
\end{problem}

\inhandout{\hint Instead of a $45^o$ diagonal, try $30^o$;
  alternatively, describe a \inj\ or \surj\ relation with
  $\power(\nngint)$.  }

\begin{solution}
 
  \begin{proof}
   We'll argue by diagonalization with ``slope -1/2'' as in
   Problem~\bref{PS_off_diagonal_arguments}.  For the sake of
   contradiction, assume $F$ is countable.  Since $L$ is certainly
   infinite, it must be in bijection with $\nngint$, so we can
   write $L = \set{s_0, s_1, s_2, \dots}$.  Define a new subset
   $t\subseteq\nngint$ of \emph{only even integers} as follows:
   \begin{equation*}
    t = \{2n\in\nngint \mid n\in\nngint \QAND 2n\notin s_n\}.
   \end{equation*}
   Because $t$ only has even integers, it is lonely, so $t\in L$.  On
   the other hand, $t\ne s_k$ for $k\in\nngint$, because one of $t$
   and $s_k$ contains $2k$ and the other does not, by construction.
   Thus, $t\notin\{s_0,s_1,s_2,\ldots\}$, i.e., $t\notin L$.  This is
   a contradiction, so our assumption that $F$ is countable must be
   false, i.e., $F$ is countable.
  \end{proof}

  A similar, alternate proof does not rely on diagonalization at all.

  \begin{proof}
   We'll show that $\powN \inj L$, which suffices because we already
   know that $\powN$ is uncountable.  Define the function $g:\powN\to
   L$ that simply doubles all entries of a given set: for any
   $s\subseteq\nngint$,
   \begin{equation*}
    g(s) \eqdef \{2k \mid k\in s\}.
   \end{equation*}
   The set $g(s)$ contains only even integers and therefore belongs to
   $F$.  We can see that $g$ is total by definition.  Furthermore, $g$
   is injective, because if $s,t\subset\nngint$ are different, then
   there is some integer $n$ with $n\in s$ and $n\notin t$ (or vice
   versa), which implies $2n\in g(s)$ and $2n\notin g(t)$ (or vice
   versa), so $g(s)\ne g(t)$.  So $g$ is a total injective relation,
   meaning $\powN \inj L$, as required.
  \end{proof}
\end{solution}
