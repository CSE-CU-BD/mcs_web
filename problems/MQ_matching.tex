Consider the bipartite graph $G$ in Figure~\ref{fig:bipartite_with_bneck}.  Is it possible to find a matching that covers $L(G)$?
If yes, explain why or show such a matching.  If no, identify a bottleneck that prevents a matching.

\end{figure}
\examspace[1in]
\begin{solution}
It is not possible.  One bottleneck is $S=\{a,b,c,e\}$, since $N(S)=\{v,x,y\}$ and hence $|S|=4>3=|N(S)|$.  (It is easy to see that there
are no bottlenecks of size 1, 2, 3, or 5.)
\end{solution}

Consider the bipartite graph $H$ in Figure~\ref{fig:deg_constrained_bipartite}.  Is it possible to find a matching that covers $L(H)$?
If yes, explain why or show such a matching.  If no, identify a bottleneck that prevents a matching.
\begin{figure}[h]
\graphic{MQ_degree_constrained_bipartite}
\caption{$H$.\label{fig:deg_constrained_bipartite}}
\end{figure}
\examspace[1in]
\begin{solution}
A matching is guaranteed to exist.  Each vertex in $L(H)$ has degree at least 3, while each vertex in $R(H)$ has degree at most 3.  Consequently,
the graph is degree-constrained.  There are therefore no bottlenecks and a matching must exist by Hall's Theorem. 
\end{solution}

In the Mating Ritual, suppose Tiger is one of the boys and Elin is one of the girls.
Which of the following are preserved invariants in general?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Tiger is Elin's only suitor.
\item Tiger is Elin's favorite.
\item Elin is the only girl on Tiger's list.
\item Tiger's optimal wife is the most preferred girl on his list.
\item If Elin is not on Tiger's list, then Elin has a suitor that she prefers to Tiger.
\item Elin does not have any boys serenading her.
\item Elin has been crossed off Tiger's list, and Tiger prefers her to whomever he is serenading.
\end{enumerate}
\examspace[2in]
\begin{solution}
The statements that are preserved invariants in general appear in boldface below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Tiger is Elin's only suitor.
\item Tiger is Elin's favorite.
\item \textbf{Elin is the only girl on Tiger's list.}
\item \textbf{Tiger's optimal wife is the most preferred girl on his list.}
\item \textbf{If Elin is not on Tiger's list, then Elin has a suitor that she prefers to Tiger.}
\item Elin does not have any boys serenading her.
\item \textbf{Elin has been crossed off Tiger's list, and Tiger prefers her to whomever he is serenading.}
\end{enumerate}
