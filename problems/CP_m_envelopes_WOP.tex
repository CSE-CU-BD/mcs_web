\begin{problem}
You are given a series of envelopes, respectively containing $1, 2, 4,
\dots, 2^m$ dollars.  Define
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Property $m$}: For any nonnegative integer less than $2^{m+1}$,
there is a selection of envelopes whose contents add up to
\emph{exactly} that number of dollars.
\end{quote}
Use the Well Ordering Principle (WOP) to prove that Property $m$ holds
for all nonnegative integers $m$.

\hint Consider two cases: first, when the target number of dollars is
less than $2^m$ and second, when the target is at least $2^m$.

\begin{staffnotes}
An easy way to see why this holds is to think about $m$ digit binary
numbers.  The binary representation of the number of dollars contained
in a selection of envelopes has a 1 for its $i$th digit iff the $i$th
envelope is in the selection (with envelopes numbered starting at 0).
So there is a selection of envelopes whose contents add up to any
given $m$ digit binary number.

This is worth pointing out at some point, maybe before, or maybe
after, students work out the WOP proof.

This also suggests alternative split into cases according to whether
target $n$ is even or odd.  Then the quotient of $n$ divided by 2 will
be smaller than $2^{m_0}$, so Property $m_0-1$ applies to the
quotient.  Then use the fact some selection of envelopes adds up to
$k$, then replacing each envelope by the \emph{next} envelope (that
contains twice as many dollars) gives selection adding up to $2k$.
\end{staffnotes}


\begin{solution}
Let $C$ be the set of positive integers $m$ such that Property $m$ is
\emph{not} true, and assume for the sake of contradiction that $C$ is
non-empty.  Then by the Well Ordering Principle (WOP), $C$ has a
smallest element $m_0$.

The first thing to notice is that Property 0 holds, because the
nonnegative integers less than $2^{0+1}$ are just one and zero, which
we can always get by selecting or not selecting the single envelope
containg one dollar.

So $m_0$ must be greater than 0, and $m_0-1$ must be a nonnegative
integer.  The definition of $m_0$ now implies that Property $m_0-1$
must hold.

We will now prove that Property $m_0$ holds, contradicting the
definition of $m_0$.  To do this, we show how to find a selection of
envelopes whose contents add up to any nonnegative integer $n$ less
than $2^{m_0+1}$.

There are two cases:

\begin{enumerate}

\item $n < 2^{m_0}$.  Now since $2^{m_0} = 2^{(m_0-1) + 1}$ and
  Property $m_0-1$ holds, we can find a subset of the first $m_0-1$
  envelopes that add up to $n$.  We don't need to use the last
  envelope containing $\$2^{m_0}$.

\item $2^{m_0} \leq n$.  Since $n < 2^{m_0+1}$, we know $n - 2^{m_0} <
  2^{m_0}$.  Therefore by Case 1, there is a selection of the first
  $m_0-1$ envelopes that adds up to $n - 2^{m_0}$ dollars.  Now add
  the last envelope, which contains $2^{m_0}$ dollars, to this
  selection to obtain a selection that adds to $n$ dollars.
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, for any $n < 2^{m_0+1}$ we can find a selection of envelopes
whose contents add up to $n$ dollars.  This means that Property $m_0$
holds, contradicting the choice of $m_0$.

This contradition implies that $C$ must be empty, proving that
Property $m$ holds for all positive integers $m$.
\end{solution}
