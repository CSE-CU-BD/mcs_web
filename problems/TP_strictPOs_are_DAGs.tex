\ppart Why is every strict partial order a DAG?

\begin{solution}
If a the strict partial was not a DAG, then it has a vertex $v$ that
is on positive length cycle.  So there is a positive length path from
$v$ to $v$, which implies that $v$ is related to itself n the partial
order.  This contradicts assymetry.
\end{solution}

\ppart Give an example of a DAG that is not a strict partial order.

\begin{solution}
$\diredge{1}{2}, \diredge{2}{3}$ but not $\diredge{1}{3}$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Why is the positive path relation of a DAG a strict partial
order?

\begin{solution}
In a DAG, there is no positive length path from a vertex to itself, so
it's positive path relation is irreflexive.  If there a a positive
length path from $u$ to $v$ and another from $v$ to $w$, thenn the
merge of the paths goes from $u$ to $w$, so the positive path relation
is transitive.  These two properties make it a strict partial order.
