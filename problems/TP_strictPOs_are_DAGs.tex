\begin{problem}
Why is every strict partial order a DAG?

\begin{solution}
Suppose the graph representation of a partial order $\prec$ has a
positive length cycle.  Then the cycle is of the form
$a_0,\dots,a_k,a_0$, where $a_0 \neq a_k$.  By definition of cycle, we
have $a_k \prec a_0$.  By transitivity of $\prec$ (an induction is
hidden here) we have $a_0 \prec a_k$.  This violates the asymmetry of
$\prec$, a contradiction.
\end{solution}
