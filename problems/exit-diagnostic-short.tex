two finite sets, $A,B$, must equal to the sum of their sizes.

Always \qquad $A \intersect B = \emptyset$ \qquad $A \subset B$ \qquad
$A \intersect B \neq \emptyset$ \quad Never

\ppart In a certain place on Earth the probability that October will
be a rainy month is 1/5, and the probability that March will be a
rainy month is 1/4.  Assume these events are independent.

  months?\hfill \examrule[0.5in]

  will \textbf{not} be rainy months?\hfill \examrule[0.5in]

\ppart Circle each of the following formulas that are valid:

\begin{romanlist}
\item $\QNOT(P \QOR Q) \QIFF [\QNOT(P) \QAND \QNOT(Q)]$
\item $\QNOT(P \QAND Q) \QIFF [\QNOT(P) \QOR \QNOT(Q)]$
\item $\forall x\, \exists y.\  P(x) \QOR \QNOT(P(y))$
\item $\exists x\, \forall y.\  P(x) \QOR \QNOT(P(y))$

\ppart Anna's toddler preschool class consists of three pairs of
non-identical twins.  Anna arbitrarily seats the six children at
two tables: table A, which can accommodate four children, and table B,
which can accommodate two children.

\begin{romanlist}

\ppart First, we flip a fair coin. If heads comes up, then we roll one
die and take the result.  If tails comes up, then we roll two dice and
take the sum of the two results.  Circle the probability that this
process yields a 2.

\begin{center}
1/36\qquad 7/72\qquad 1/6\qquad 7/36\qquad Other

\ppart Tom and Jerry are two applicants for the same summer internship
at Google.  Since Tom and Jerry are equally qualified, Marla, who has
to hire one of them, decides to toss a coin exactly three times.  Tom
will get the internship if at least two heads are obtained, otherwise
Jerry will.  Marla's coin turns out to have a bias in favor of Tails.
Explain who has a higher probability of being accepted to the Google
Internship.
