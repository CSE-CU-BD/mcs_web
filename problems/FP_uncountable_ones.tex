\begin{problem}
Let $\binw$ be the set of infinite binary strings, and let $B \subset
\binw$ be the set of infinite binary strings containing infinitely
many occurrences of 1's.  Prove that $B$ is uncountable.  (We have
already shown that $\binw$ is uncountable.)

\hint Define a suitable function from $\binw$ to $B$.

\begin{solution}
Since $\binw$ is uncountable, it is sufficient to prove that $B \surj
\binw$, which is equivalent to $\binw \inj B$.  That is, it's sufficient to
define a total injective function $f:\binw \to B$.

An easy way to define such an $f$ is to define, for any infinite
string $b \in \binw$, the value of $f(b)$ to be the string obtained by
inserting a 1 between each of the bits in $b$.
\end{solution}
