\begin{problem}
Let $\binw$ be the set of infinite binary strings, and let $\binw_1
\subset \binw$ be the set of infinite binary strings containing
infinitely many occurrences of \texttt{1}.  Prove that $\binw_1$ is
uncountable.  (We have already shown that $\binw$ is uncountable.)

\hint Define a suitable function from $\binw$ to $\binw_1$.

\begin{solution}
Since $\binw$ is uncountable, it is sufficient to prove that $\binw_1 \surj
\binw$, which is equivalent to $\binw \inj \binw_1$.  That is, it's sufficient to
define a total injective function $f:B \to \binw_1$.

An easy way to define such an $f$ is to define, for any infinite
string $b \in \binw$, the value of $f(b)$ to be the string obtained by
inserting a 1 between each of the bits is $b$.
\end{solution}
