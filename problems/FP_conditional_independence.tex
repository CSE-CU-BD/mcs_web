\begin{problem}
Here is a straightforward modification of the notion of independence. 
Events $A, B, C$ are said to be \emph{conditionally
  independent} if 
\[
\prcond{A \intersect B}{C} = \prcond{A}{C} \cdot \prcond{B}{C} .
\]

Give a counterexample disproving the following
%\bparts

%\ppart

\begin{falseclm*}
If $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given $C$, and are also
conditionally independent given $D$, then $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given $C
\union D$.
\end{falseclm*}

\hint $C=A$, $D=\bar{A}$.

\begin{solution}
A simple counterexample is as follows. Notice that $A$ is certain given $A$, so everything is independent of
$A$ given $A$, and similarly everything is independent of $A$ given
$\bar{A}$.  But an event is independent of $A$ given $A \union
\bar{A}$ iff it simply is independent of $A$.  So $C=A$, $D=\bar{A}$, and
$B$ any event that is not independent of $A$ provides a
counterexample.

%\begin{staffnotes}
Here is an alternate, more formal argument. Let $B$ and $C$ be $A$, and $D$ be $\bar{A}$.  Then
\begin{align*}
\prcond{A \intersect B}{C}
  & = \pr{A \intersect A}/\pr{A}\\
  & = 1\\
  & = \prcond{A}{A} \cdot \prcond{A}{A}\\
  & = \prcond{A}{C} \cdot \prcond{B}{C},
\end{align*}
and so $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given $C$.  Similarly,
\[
\prcond{A \intersect B}{D} = 0 = \prcond{A}{D} \cdot \prcond{B}{D} 
\]
and so $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given $D$.

$A$ and $B$ are independent given $C \union D$ iff $A$ is
independent of $A$, which is clearly false for all nontrivial events $A$.

\end{solution}
