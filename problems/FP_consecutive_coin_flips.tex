\begin{problem}

Suppose we flip a fair coin and let $N_\mathtt{TT}$ be the
number of flips until the first time two consecutive Tails appear.  What
is $\expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}$?  Justify your answer by working with formal
probability expressions algebraically.

\hint Let $D$ be the tree diagram for this process.  Explain why
$D$ can be described by the tree in Figure~\ref{tree_D}.
\iffalse
\[
D = H\cdot D + T\cdot(H\cdot D + T).
\]
\fi
Use the \textbf{Law of Total Expectation}%
\inbook{~\bref{total_expect}.}%
\inhandout{: Let $R$~be a random variable and $A_1$, $A_2$, \dots, be
  a partition of the sample space.  Then
\[
    \expect{R} = \sum_i \expcond{R}{A_i} \prob{A_i}.
\]

\begin{solution}
\[
\expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}=6.
\]

Let $H$ be the event that a Head appears on the first flip, $TH$ the
event that the first flips are Tail then Head, and likewise $TT$.
From $D$ and the Law of Total Expectation:

\begin{align*}
\expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}
    & = \expcond{N_\mathtt{TT}}{H}    \cdot \pr{H}
       + \expcond{N_\mathtt{TT}}{TH}  \cdot \pr{TH}
       + \expcond{N_\mathtt{TT}}{TT}  \cdot \pr{TT}\\ 
  & = \paren{1 + \expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}}\cdot \frac{1}{2} +
      \paren{2 + \expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}}\cdot \frac{1}{4} +
       2 \cdot \frac{1}{4}\\
  & = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}}{2}
       + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}}{4}
       + \frac{1}{2}\\
  & = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3\expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}}{4}
\end{align*}
So
\[
\expect{N_\mathtt{TT}} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 4 = 6.
\]
\end{solution}
