\begin{problem}
\iffalse
Give an example of a pair of strictly increasing total functions, $f:\naturals^+\to\naturals^+$ and 
$g:\naturals^+\to\naturals^+$, such that $f\sim g$ but $3^f\neq O\paren{3^g}$.

Give an example of a pair of strictly increasing functions, $f:\naturals^+\to\naturals^+$ and
$g:\naturals^+\to\naturals^+$, that satisfy $f\sim g$ but \textbf{not} $3^f=O\paren{3^g}$.
\begin{solution}
The pair
\begin{align*}
f(n)&=n^2+n\\
g(n)&=n^2
\end{align*}
satisfies these criteria.  Since $n^2$ is the term that dominates the behavior of $n^2+n$ as 
$n$ grows large, it is obvious that $n^2+n\sim n^2$.  (Applying the limit definition of asymptotic
equality readily establishes this result.)  Clearly, $3^{f(n)}=3^{n^2+n}=3^n 3^{n^2}$, while
$3^{g(n)}=3^{n^2}$.  Thus $3^{f(n)}=3^n3^{g(n)}$.  From this, it is obvious that $3^f\neq O\paren{3^g}$.
(It is very easy to check that, in fact, $g=o(f)$.)
\end{solution}
