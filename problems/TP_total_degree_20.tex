\begin{problem}
Among connected simple graphs with total degree 20:
\bparts
\ppart what is the largest possible number of vertices? \hfill\examrule
\begin{solution}
\textbf{11}.

With total degree 20 there are 10 edges.  The largest number of
vertices in a connected graph with 10 edges is a tree with 11 vertices.
\end{solution}

\ppart what is the smallest possible number of vertices? \hfill\examrule
\begin{solution}
\textbf{5}.

A complete graph has the largest possible number of edges for a given
number of vertices.  The complete graph $K_5$ has 10 edges.
