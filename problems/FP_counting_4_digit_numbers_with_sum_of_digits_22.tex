\begin{problem}

Suppose $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$ are nonnegative integers.  You may answer
the following questions using closed formulas possibly involving
binomial coefficients without calculating a final numerical answer.

\bparts

\ppart  How many solns are there to the inequality $x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=22$?
\begin{solution}
$\binom{25}{3}$

\end{solution}
\ppart How many solutions such that exactly one of the $x_i$'s is
greater than nine?

\begin{solution}
\[
\binom{4}{1} \cdot \binom{15}{3}
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart How many solutions such that exactly two of the $x_i$'s are
greater than nine?

\begin{solution}
\[
\binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{5}{3}
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart How many 4-digit numbers with sum of digits equal to 22 are
there?  You many express your answer in terms of numbers $a,b,c$ which
are the answers to the previous parts of this problem.

How many 4-digit numbers with sum of digits equal to 22 are there?

\hint{Exclusion-Inclusion.}

\begin{solution}
Let $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$ and $x_4$ be the digits of a 4-digit number $a$. Let
\begin{align*}
A & = \set{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \in \integers^4 \suchthat 0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \leq 9 \QAND x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4 = 22} \\
S & = \set{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \in \integers^4 \suchthat x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \geq 0 \QAND x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4 = 22} \\
S_i & = \set{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \in \integers^4 \suchthat x_i \geq 10 \QAND x_j \geq 0, j \neq i \QAND x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4 = 22} \\
S_{i,j} & = \set{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \in \integers^4 \suchthat x_i, x_j \geq 10 \QAND x_k \geq 0, k \neq i,j \QAND x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4 = 22} \, .
\end{align*}
Then, $A = S \setminus (\union_i S_i)$ and
\begin{align*}
|A| & = |S| - \sum_{i=1}^4 |S_i| + \sum_{1\leq i < j \leq 4} |S_{i,j}| \\
     & = {22+4-1 \choose 4-1} - {4 \choose 1} {12+4-1 \choose 4-1} + {4 \choose 2} {2+4-1 \choose 4-1} \\
     & = {25 \choose 3} - 4 {15 \choose 3} + 6 {5 \choose 3} \\
     & = 2300 - 4 \cdot 455 + 6 \cdot 10 = 540 \, .
\end{align*}
