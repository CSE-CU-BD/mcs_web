\begin{problem}
Prove that the set of all finite subsets of nonnegative integers is
countable.

\hint: Think about
\[
\text{sum}(F) \eqdef \text{the sum of the elements in $F$}.
\]

\begin{solution}   
There are only a finite number of sets of nonnegative integers whose
sum is $n$: all the elements in the set are $\leq n$, and there are at
most about $n+1$ of them, so $n^{n+1}$ bounds the number of these
sets. (There are much smaller bounds, but any one will do.)
   
So just list all the elements in order of their sum, with elements
with the same sum ordered arbitrarily.  This list defines a bijection
with N.
\end{solution}
