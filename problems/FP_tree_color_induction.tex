\begin{problem}
Prove that, using a fixed set of three colors, there are $3\cdot 2^{n-1}$
different 3-colorings\inhandout{\footnote{That is, an assignment of
    colors to vertices so that no two adjacent vertices are assigned
    the same color.}} of any tree with $n$ vertices.

\begin{solution}
We restrict ourselves to 3-colorings using three given colors.

\begin{proof}
By induction on the number of vertices $n$.  The induction hypothesis is

$P(n) \eqdef$ For all $n$-vertex trees, $T$, there are $3\cdot 2^n$ different 3-colorings of $T$.

\inductioncase{Base case}: ($n=1$).  There are $3 = 3 \cdot 2^{1-1}$
ways to color one vertex.

\inductioncase{Induction step}: Let $T$ be a tree with $n+1$ vertices
for some $n \geq 1$.  Let $v$ be a leaf of $T$.  Then removing $v$ and
its incident edges, we obtain a tree $T-v$ with $n$ vertices.  We may
assume by induction that there are $3 \cdot 2^{n-1}$ 3-colorings of
$T-v$.  For each such 3-ooloring of $T-v$, there are two ways to
extend it to a 3-ooloring of $T$, so there are $2 (3 \cdot 2^{n-1}) =
3 \cdot 2^n$ colorings of $T$, which proves $P(n+1)$.
\end{proof}
