\begin{problem}
In this problem, we will give recursive definitions of some sets of binary strings.  The only constructor operations you may use are concatenations of
strings. \footnote{The concatenation of two strings $x$ and $y$, written
$xy$, is the string obtained by appending $y$ to the end of $x$. For
example, the concatenation of $01$ and $101$ is $01101$.}

For example, ZERO, the set of strings entirely made of $0$'s is defined recursively as follows:

BASE CASE: empty string is in ZERO

CONSTRUCTOR CASE: if $s$ is in ZERO, then so is $s0$.

Now, define the following recursively.

\bparts

\ppart ONE$0$, the set of binary strings with exactly one $0$. Examples of strings in ONE$0$: $0$, $10$, $101111$.

\begin{solution}
BASE CASE: $0$ is in ONE$0$

CONSTRUCTOR CASE: if $s$ is in ONE$0$, then so are $1s$ and $s1$.
\end{solution}

\ppart EVEN, the set of binary strings of even length.

\begin{solution}
BASE CASE: the empty string is in EVEN

CONSTRUCTOR CASE: if $s$ is in EVEN, then so are $s11$, $s10$, $s00$ and $s01$.
\end{solution}

\ppart ODD-LENGTH-PALINDROME = the set of strings $s$ of odd length that are identical if read left-to-right and right-to-left, that is $s = \text{reverse}(s)$. Examples of strings in ODD-LENGTH-PALINDROME: $1$, $0110110$, $111$.

\begin{solution}
BASE CASE: $1$ and $0$ are in ODD-LENGTH-PALINDROME

CONSTRUCTOR CASE: if $s$ is in ODD-LENGTH-PALINDROME, then so are $1s1$ and $0s0$.
\end{solution}
