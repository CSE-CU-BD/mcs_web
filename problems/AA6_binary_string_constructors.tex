\begin{problem}
Let call a recursive definition of a set of strings \catOK\ when all
its constructors are defined as concatenations of
strings.\footnote{The concatenation of two strings $x$ and $y$,
  written $xy$, is the string obtained by appending $x$ to the left 
  end of $y$.  For example, the concatenation of $01$ and $101$ is
  $01101$.}

The set \finbin\ of all binary strings has the following basic \catOK\ definition:

\begin{definition}
The set \finbin\ of all finite binary strings is defined recursively as follows:

\inductioncase{Base case}:  $\emptystring \in \finbin$.

\inductioncase{Constructor case}: If $x \in \finbin$, then so are $s0$
and $s1$.
\end{definition}

Here, for example, is a recursive definition of this kind for the set
\Zerostr\ of all strings entirely made of $0$'s:

\inductioncase{Base case}:  $\emptystring \in \Zerostr$.

\inductioncase{Constructor case}: If $s \in \Zerostr$, then so is
$s0$.

Now, define the following recursively.

\bparts

\ppart ONE$0$, the set of binary strings with exactly one $0$. Examples of strings in ONE$0$: $0$, $10$ $101111$.

\begin{solution}
BASE CASE: $0$ is in ONE$0$

CONSTRUCTOR CASE: if $s$ is in ONE$0$, then so are $1s$ and $s1$.
\end{solution}

\ppart EVEN, the set of binary strings of even length.

\begin{solution}
BASE CASE: the empty string is in EVEN

CONSTRUCTOR CASE: if $s$ is in EVEN, then so are $s11$, $s10$, $s00$ and $s01$.
\end{solution}

\ppart ODD-LENGTH-PALINDROME = the set of strings $s$ of odd length that are identical if read left-to-right and right-to-left, that is $s = \text{reverse}(s)$. Examples of strings in ODD-LENGTH-PALINDROME: $1$, $0110110$, $111$.

\begin{solution}
BASE CASE: $1$ and $0$ are in ODD-LENGTH-PALINDROME

CONSTRUCTOR CASE: if $s$ is in ODD-LENGTH-PALINDROME, then so are $1s1$ and $0s0$.
\end{solution}
