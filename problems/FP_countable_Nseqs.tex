\begin{problem}
Prove that the set $\strings{\nngint}$ of all finite sequences of
nonnegative integers is countable.

\hint $\text{norm}(n_1 n_2 \dots n_k) \eqdef \max\set{k, n_1, n_2, \dots, n_k}$.


\begin{solution}   
There are only a finite number sequences of nonnegative integers with
norm $n$: all the elements in the sequence are $\leq n$, and there are
at most $n$ of them.  No explicit bound on the number of such
sequences was required.  (Since there are at most $(n+1)^i$ such
sequences of length $i$, a course bound on the number of sequences
norm at most $n$ is $(n+1) \cdot (n+1)^n$.
   
So to list all the elements in $\strings{\nngint}$ just list all the
elements in order of their norm, with elements with the same norm
ordered arbitrarily (say by dictionary order).  This list defines a
bijection with \nngint.
\end{solution}
