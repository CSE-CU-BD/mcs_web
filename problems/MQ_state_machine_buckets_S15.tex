\begin{problem}
% Tests understanding of state machines

The Stata Center's delicate balance depends on two buckets of water
hidden in a secret room.  The big bucket has a volume of 25 gallons,
and the little bucket has a volume of 10 gallons.  If at any time a
bucket contains exactly \textcolor{red}{13 gallons}, the Stata Center
will collapse.  There is an interactive display where tourists can
remotely fill and empty the buckets according to certain rules.  We
represent the buckets as a state machine.

The state of the machine is a pair $(b, l)$, where $b$ is the volume
of water in big bucket, and $l$ is the volume of water in little
bucket.

\problempart\label{1025moves} We informally describe some of the legal
operations tourists can perform below.  Represent each of the
following operations as a transition of the state machine.  The first
is done for you as an example.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fill the big bucket.
\[
(b,l) \movesto (25, l).
\]
%\item Fill the little bucket.
%\item Empty the big bucket.

\item Empty the little bucket.

\item Pour the big bucket into the little bucket.  You should have two
  cases defined in terms of the state $(b,l)$: if all the water from
  the big bucket fits in the little bucket, then pour all the water.
  If it doesn't, pour until the little jar is full, leaving some water
  remaining in the big jar.

%\item Pour the little bucket into the big bucket (two cases again).
\end{enumerate}

\problempart Use the Invariant Principle to show that, starting with
empty buckets, the Stata Center will never collapse.  That is, the
state $(13, x)$ in unreachable.  (In verifying your claim that the
invariant is preserved, you may restrict to the representative
transitions of part~\eqref{1025moves}.)

\begin{staffnotes}
A simple invariant is that $5$ divides $b$ and $l$.
