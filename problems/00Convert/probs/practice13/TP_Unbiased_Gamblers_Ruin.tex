\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Unbiased Gambler's Ruin

\bparts

\ppart

In the unbiased Gambler's ruin game, if the Gambler's initial capital
is \$40, what is the probability that his capital at some point grows
to be \$100?

\begin{solution}
2/5

The answer is the quotient of capital and goal amount, namely,
$40/100$.
\end{solution}

\ppart

The topic of expected number of bets was omitted from the Spring~'10
Notes.  It turns out that in the unbiased game, the expected number of
bets is the product of the gamblers initial capital and intended
profit.  So the expected number of bets made until the game ends is?

\begin{solution}
2400

The intended profit is $100-40 = 60$, so the expected number of bets
is $40 \cdot 60$.
\end{solution}
