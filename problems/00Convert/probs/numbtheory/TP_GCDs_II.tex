\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: GCD's II

Compute the GCD of the following two numbers: 
\begin{align*}
    x & = 17^{88} * 31^{5} * 37^{2} * 59^{1000}  \\
    y & = 19^{(9^{22})} * 37^{12} * 53^{3678} * 59^{29}.
\end{align*}

Please give the prime factorization of your answer as a set of
(\emph{prime exponent}) pairs.  For example, to write  
the number $60 = 2^{2} * 3 * 5$, you can write
\begin{equation*}
(3 1) (2 2) (5 1)
\end{equation*}

The order in which you give your pairs does not matter.

\begin{solution}

(37 2) (59 29)


To get the GCD of two numbers: iterate over all primes that appear in
both factorizations; raise each of them to the \emph{smallest} of its
two exponents; then multiply the resulting powers.

By the way, if in this procedure you replace \emph{smallest} with
\emph{greatest}, the return value will be the LCM (least common
multiple) of the two numbers.
\end{solution}
