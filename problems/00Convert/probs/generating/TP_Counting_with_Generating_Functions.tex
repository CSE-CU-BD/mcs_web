%% type: short-answer
%% title: Counting with Generating Functions

Let $a_{n}$ be the number of ways to make
change for \$$n$ using \$2 and \$3 tokens.  For example,
$a_{5} = 1$ because the only way to make change for \$5 is
with one \$2 token and one \$3 token, but $a_{6} = 2$ because
there are two ways to make change for \$6, namely using three \$2 tokens or
using two \$3 tokens.

Identify the generating function for the sequence of $a_{n}$'s.

\begin{solution}
\[ 1/(1-x^2)(1-x^3)\]

Using \$2 tokens, there is only one way to make change for \$$n$ when
$n$ is even, and no way to do it when $n$ is odd.  So the generating
function for the number of ways to make change for \$$n$ using only
\$2 tokens is
\begin{equation*}
    1+x^2+x^4+x^6+\cdots = \frac{1}{1-x^2}
\end{equation*}

Similarly, the generating function for the number of ways to make
change for \$$n$ using only \$3 tokens
is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{1-x^3}
\end{equation*}

The generating function for the number of ways to make change using both kinds of tokens is the product of the generating functions for each kind of token.
\end{solution}
