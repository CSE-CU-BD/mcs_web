\begin{problem}

%-----------------------------------------------
% source: Rosen 7.8.21 (rewritten to be more clear)
% topics: coloring application (register coloring)
% last used: first time

My computer program has seven variables, {\tt t,u,v,w,x,y,z},
and computes in 6 steps. The steps in which each variable is used are
as follows: {\tt t:} steps 1 through 6; {\tt u:} step 2; {\tt v:}
steps 2 through 4; {\tt w:} steps 1,3 and 5; {\tt x:} steps 1 and 6;
{\tt y:} steps 3 through 6; {\tt z:} steps 4 and 5. Each variable will
need to occupy the same index register at each one of the steps in
which it is going to be used; however during the steps when the
variable is not being used the register may be used by some other
variable. How many such registers are needed for my program? Explain
how you arrived at the answer.

\begin{solution}
This problem shows an application of graph coloring to
register allocation in a processor. Consider a simple graph $G$ having
the seven variables as its nodes, and an edge between two variables
iff there is at least one step of the program during which both
variables are going to be used.  Figure~\ref{fig:vars} contains the
graph we are talking about.

\end{figure}

Clearly, two variables have to occupy different index registers iff
they are going to be used simultaneously sometime during the
progam execution, that is, iff they are connected in~$G$. 

To correctly and economically assign variables to registers means to
map each variable to one register in a way that does not cause
collisions (two simultaneously used variables mapped to the same
register) and uses as few registers as possible. But (if we think of
registers as colors) this is the same as to color $G$ in a way that
does not cause neighboring vertices of the same color and uses as few
colors as possible. So, we have reduced the original problem to the
problem of coloring~$G$.

Figure~\ref{fig:varscol} shows such a coloring, using 5 colors. To see
that this is the minimum one, just notice that variables $t$, $v$,
$w$, $y$, and $z$ form a 5-vertex subgraph which is complete, and
hence cannot be colored with less than~5 colors.

SIDE NOTE: In this problem we have assumed that a variable must always
use the same register, i.e. a variable is assigned a single
color. However in a real compiler this is overly restrictive because a
variable is backed up into memory every time it is evicted from the
register set and then reloaded from memory into the register set when
it needs to be used again. When it is reloaded there is no reason why
the same register must be used. For example, say we had a variable $x$
which is used in steps 1,2,3 and then later used in step 6. Then $x$
could be stored in register $r1$ for steps 1 through 3 and some other
register $r2$ for step 6. We can still use coloring to solve the
problem by treating $x$ as two separate variables: $x_{123}$ and
$x_6$. Since the number of variables in a computer program can be very
large and the register set of a processor is typically much smaller
(16-64 registers), register allocation is an important piece of
compiling.
