\begin{problem}
The purpose of this question is to prove the validity of strong
induction using regular induction.  If $P$ is a predicate on the
non-negative integers, then strong induction can be expressed as the
following implication:
\begin{equation}
\label{strong induction}
\paren{\forall n. \; [\forall k . \; k < n \QIMPLIES P(k)] \QIMPLIES P(n)} \QIMPLIES \forall m. \; P(m)
\end{equation}

Prove, by ordinary mathematical induction, the validity of \eqref{strong induction}.

\smallskip

\hint Let $P(n)$ be an arbitrary predicate over the non-negative
integers and assume that the left half of \eqref{strong induction}
holds using this predicate.  Using that assumption, prove, by
induction, that the right half of \eqref{strong induction} holds. The
inductive hypothesis for that proof, $H(n)$, will have to be in terms
of $P(n)$.

\begin{solution}

\begin{proof}

Let $P(n)$ be an arbitrary predicate over the non-negative integers,
and assume that the left half of \eqref{strong induction} holds for
this predicate.  Define an inductive hypothesis $H(n)$ by
\[
H(n) ::= \forall m. \; m \leq n \QIMPLIES P(m)
\]

\inductioncase{Base Case:} Setting $n=0$ makes \mbox{$[\forall k . \; k < n
    \QIMPLIES P(k)] \QIMPLIES P(n)$} logically equivalent to $P(0)$
(because no $k$ is less than 0), which is equivalent to $H(0)$.

\inductioncase{Inductive Step:} Assume $H(n)$, that is \mbox{$\forall
  m. \; m \leq n \QIMPLIES P(m)$}.  $H(n)$ implies \mbox{$\forall k. \;
  k < n+1 \QIMPLIES P(k)$}, then using the left side of $\eqref{strong
  induction}$, we get $P(n+1)$.  So we have $H(n) \text{ AND }
P(n+1)$, which implies $H(n+1)$.

\end{proof}

Having proved the base case and inductive step for $H(n)$, we get, by
induction, that $\forall n. \; H(n)$.  That is \mbox{$\forall
  n. \forall m. \; m < n \QIMPLIES P(n)$}, but this is equivalent to
$\forall m. \; P(m)$.  So the right side of $\eqref{strong induction}$
holds.

\end{solution}
