\begin{problem}
\begin{proposition*}

  If a sequence of positive integers has sum $n \geq 1$, then the
  product of elements in the sequence is at most $3^{n/3}$.

\end{proposition*}

For example, the sequence 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7, has the sum:
\[
    2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 7 = 22,
\]
and sure enough, the product is:
\[
2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 7
     =  1344 \\
     \leq  3^{22/3} \\
     \approx  3154.2
\]

\ppart Use strong induction to prove that $n \leq 3^{n/3}$ for every
integer $n \geq 0$.

\begin{solution}
The proof is by strong induction.  Let $P(n)$ be the
proposition that $n \leq 3^{n/3}$.  First, we show that $P(0)$,
$P(1)$, $P(2)$, $P(3)$, and $P(4)$ are true:

\begin{align*}
0^3 \leq 3^0 & \rightarrow  0 \leq 3^{0/3} \\
1^3 \leq 3^1 & \rightarrow  1 \leq 3^{1/3} \\
2^3 \leq 3^2 & \rightarrow  2 \leq 3^{2/3} \\
3^3 \leq 3^3 & \rightarrow  3 \leq 3^{3/3} \\
4^3 \leq 3^4 & \rightarrow  4 \leq 3^{4/3} \\
\end{align*}

Each implication follows by taking cube roots.  Next, we show that
$P(0), \ldots, P(n)$ imply $P(n + 1)$ for all $n \geq 4$.  Thus, we
assume that $P(0), \ldots, P(n)$ are all true and reason as follows:

\begin{align*}
3^{(n + 1)/3}
    & =     3 \cdot 3^{(n-2)/3} \\
    & \geq 3 \cdot (n - 2) \\
    & \geq n + 1 \hspace{1in} \text{(for all $n \geq 7/2$)}
\end{align*}

The first step is algebra.  The second step uses our assumption $P(n -
2)$.  The third step is a linear inequality that holds for all $n \geq
7/2$.  (This forced us to deal individually with the cases $P(3)$ and
$P(4)$, above.) Therefore, $P(n + 1)$ is true, and so $P(n)$ is true
for all $n \geq 0$ by induction.
\end{solution}

\ppart Prove the Proposition by induction.

\begin{staffnotes}

\hint Use induction on the \emph{length of the sequence} rather than on
the value of the sum.

\end{staffnotes}

\examspace[4in]

\begin{solution}
  We use induction on the length of the sequence.  Let $P(k)$ be the
  proposition that every sequence of $k$ positive integers with sum $n$
  has product at most $3^{n/3}$.  First, note that $P(1)$ is true by the
  preceding problem part.

  Next, we must show that $P(k)$ implies $P(k + 1)$ for all $k \geq 1$.
  So assume that $P(k)$ is true, and let $x_1, \ldots, x_{k+1}$ be a
  sequence of $k+1$ positive integers with sum $n$.  Then we can reason as
  follows:

\begin{align*}
x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdots x_k \cdot x_{k+1}
    & \leq  3^{(n - x_{k+1}) / 3} \cdot x_{k+1} \\
    & \leq  3^{(n - x_{k+1}) / 3} \cdot 3^{x_{k+1} / 3} \\
    & =  3^{n / 3}
\end{align*}
The first step uses the assumption $P(k)$, the second uses the
preceding problem part, and the last step is algebra.  This shows that
$P(k + 1)$ is true, and so the claim holds by induction.
