\begin{problem}

\textbf{Circle} the correct completions (there may be more than
one)

$A \strict \naturals \ \QIFF$ \dots
\begin{itemize}
\item $\card{A}$ is undefined.

\item $A$ is countably infinite.

\item $A$ is uncountable.

\item $A$ is finite.

\item $\naturals \surj A$.

\item $\forall n \in \naturals$, $\card{A} \leq n$.

\item $\forall n \in \naturals$, $\card{A} \geq n$.

\item $\exists n \in \naturals.\, \card{A} \leq n$.

\item $\exists n \in \naturals.\, \card{A} < n$.

\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}
$A$ is finite;  $\exists n \in \naturals.\, \card{A} \leq n$;
$\exists n \in \naturals.\, \card{A} < n$.
\end{solution}
