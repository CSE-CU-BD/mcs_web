\begin{problem}
  Remember this awesome graph from last miniquiz? Let's solve some more fun problems about it!

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=2in]{figures/planar_graph_morning.pdf}
\end{center}

\bparts

\ppart What is its chromatic number? \brule{0.4in}

\ppart Notice that it's a connected planar graph. Describe all of its discrete faces.

\eparts

\begin{solution}
TBA
