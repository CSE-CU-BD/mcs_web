\begin{problem}
  Remember this awesome graph from last miniquiz? Let's solve some more fun problems about it!

\ppart What is its chromatic number? \brule{0.4in}

\begin{solution}
The graph has an odd length cycle, so its chromatic number must be at least 3. We can find a 3-coloring of the graph (color A, B, and E red, color C and D blue, and color F green), so its chromatic number must be 3.
\end{solution}


\ppart Notice that it's a connected planar graph. Describe all of its discrete faces.

\begin{solution}
Here is one possible answer: \\
ACBDA \\
BDFECB \\
ADFECA
