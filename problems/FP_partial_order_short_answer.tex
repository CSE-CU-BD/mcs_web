\begin{problem}

%\set{(a,b) | a<b} \text{ on the set of integers }\quad & \examrule{1in}\\
%% Added
%\set{(a,b) | a^2 \leq b^2} \text{ on the set of real numbers }\quad & \examrule{1in}\\

For each of the relations below, indicate whether it is
\begin{quote}
a \emph{weak partial order} (\textbf{WPO}), \quad a \emph{strict
  partial order} (\textbf{SPO}),

and if so, whether it is\emph{path-total} (\textbf{Tot})
\end{quote}

If it is neither (\textbf{WPO}) nor (\textbf{SPO}), indicate whether it is
\begin{quote}
\emph{transitive} (\textbf{Tr}), \qquad  \emph{symmetric}
(\textbf{Sym}), \qquad  \emph{asymmetric} (\textbf{Asym})
\end{quote}
