\ppart Indicate which of the following relations below are equivalence
relations, (\textbf{E}), strict partial orders (\textbf{S}), weak
partial orders (\textbf{W}).  For the partial orders, also indicate
whether it is \emph{linear} (\textbf{T}).

If a relation is none of the above, indicate whether it is
\emph{transitive} (\textbf{Tr}), \emph{symmetric} (\textbf{Sym}), or
\emph{asymmetric} (\textbf{Asym}).

\begin{enumerate}
\item The relation $a = b + 1$ between integers, $a$, $b$,

\item The superset relation, $\supseteq$ on the power set of the integers.
\hfill \examrule[0.7in]

  random variables $R,S$.

\ppart A set of functions $f,g:\reals \to \reals$ can be partially ordered
by the $\leq$ relation, where
\[
[f \leq g] \eqdef \forall r \in \reals.\, f(r) \leq g(r).
\]
Let $L$ be the set of functions $f:\reals \to \reals$ of the form
\[
f(x) = ax+b
\]
for real constants $a,b \neq 0$.

Describe an infinite chain and an infinite anti-chain in $L$.

\inhandout{\hint Think about parallel lines.}

\begin{solution}
If $f,g \in L$, then $f \leq g$ iff the lines defined by $f$ and $g$
are parallel.  That is, if $f(x) = ax +b$ and $g(x) = cx + d$, then $f
\leq g$ iff $a = c$ and $b \leq d$.

So the set $L_a$ of functions of the form $ax +1$ for $a \in \reals$,
for example, form an infinite anti-chain; in fact, $L_a$ is a
\emph{maximal} anti-chain, since any function in $L - L_a$ would be
parallel to, and hence comparable to, some function in $L_a$.

Likewise, the set of functions $x + b$ where $b \neq 0$ is an example
of an infinite chain, and in fact a \emph{maximal} chain.
\end{solution}

\iffalse

For the next three parts, let $f,g$ be nonnegative functions from the
integers to the real numbers.

\ppart  The ``Big Oh'' relation, $f=O(g)$,  \hfill \examrule[0.7in]

\begin{solution}
\textbf{Tr}
\end{solution}

\ppart  The ``Little Oh'' relation, $f=o(g)$,  \hfill \examrule[0.7in]

\begin{solution}
\textbf{SPO}
\end{solution}

\ppart The ``asymptotically equal'' relation, $f \sim g$.  \hfill \examrule[0.7in]

\begin{solution}
\textbf{Tr, Sym}
\end{solution}
