\begin{problem}
% 

Consider the bipartite graph $G$ in Figure~\ref{fig:bipartite_with_bneck}. Explain why there is no matching that covers $L(G)$? \\
(Hint: Hall's Theorem. Also looking at the graph from right to left may be easier)

\begin{figure}[h]
\graphic{MQ_bipartite_with_bottleneck}
\caption{$G$.\label{fig:bipartite_with_bneck}}
\end{figure}


\begin{solution}
It is not possible.  One bottleneck is $S=\{a,b,c,e\}$, since $N(S)=\{v,x,y\}$ and hence $|S|=4>3=|N(S)|$.  (It is easy to see that there
are no bottlenecks of size 1, 2, 3, or 5.)
\end{solution}
