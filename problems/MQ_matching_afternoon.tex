\begin{problem}
Explain why the bipartite graph $G$ in
Figure~\ref{fig:bipartite_with_bneck} has no \idx{matching} that
covers $\leftbi{G}$.

\hint Looking at the graph from right to left may be easier.

\iffalse
Consider the bipartite graph $G$ in
Figure~\ref{fig:bipartite_with_bneck}. Explain why there is no
matching that covers $L(G)$? \\ (Hint: Hall's Theorem. Also looking at
the graph from right to left may be easier)

\end{figure}


\begin{solution}
It is not possible because $\set{a,b,c,e}$ is a bottleneck:
$\card{N(\set{a,b,c,e})} = \card{\set{v,x,y}} = 3 < 4 =
\card{\set{a,b,c,e}}$.

Since the left and right vertex sets of $G$ are the same size, there
is a bottleneck on the right iff there is one on the left.  So an
alternative answer is to observe that $\set{w,z}$ is a bottleneck in
the other direction: $\card{N^{-1}(\set{w,z})} = \card{\set{d}} = 1 <
2 = \card{\set{w,z}}$.

\iffalse
(It is easy to see that there are no
bottlenecks of size 1, 2, 3, or 5.)
