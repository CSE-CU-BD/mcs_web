\begin{problem}
  \bparts The queen and king of hearts decide to host a poker game and
  invite their best friends: the queens and kings of clubs, diamonds,
  and spades.  The queen has a round table with eight chairs for these
  eight people.
%  for the guests (the $3$ other couples) and the host and hostess (her
%  husband and herself).

\ppart \mbox{}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{figures/round_table.pdf}
\end{center}

If each of the chairs around the table is marked with a distinct symbol in
$\set{P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_8}$, how many ways can the queen seat the $8$
people in the $8$ chairs?

\examspace[1in]
\begin{solution}
$8!$

%\begin{definition}

Two \emph{seatings} are defined to be equivalent if one is a
rotation of the other.  For example, the two seatings below are
considered equivalent:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
$P_1$ & $P_2$ &$P_3$ &$P_4$ & $P_5$ & $P_6$ & $P_7$ & $P_8$ \\ \hline \hline
$K\spa$ & $Q\spa$ & $K\hea$ & $Q\hea$ & $K\dia$ & $Q\dia$ & $K\clu$ & $Q\clu$ \\ \hline
$K\dia$ & $Q\dia$ & $K\clu$ & $Q\clu$ & $K\spa$ & $Q\spa $ & $K\hea$ & $Q\hea$ \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

%\begin{eqnarray*}
%K\spa, Q\spa, K\hea, Q\hea, K\dia, Q\dia, K\clu, Q\clu \\
%Q\hea, K\dia, Q\dia, K\clu, Q\clu, K\spa, Q\spa, K\hea 
%\end{eqnarray*}
%\end{definition}

How many distinct \textbf{seatings} are there?

\begin{solution}
\[
\frac{8!}{8} = 7!
\]

%\inhandout{\instatements{\newpage}}

\ppart How many distinct \textbf{seatings} are there if the queen and king of
hearts must be seated next to each other?
\hint Think of the king and queen as a single unit.

\examspace[1in]
\begin{solution}
$2! \cdot \frac{7!}{7} = 2 \cdot 6!$
\end{solution}

\ppart How many distinct \textbf{seatings} are there if the queen and
king of hearts must be seated next to each other, and the queen and
king of spades must also be seated next to each other?

\examspace[1in]
\begin{solution}
$2! \cdot 2! \cdot \frac{6!}{6} = 4 \cdot 5!$
\end{solution}

\ppart How many distinct {\bf seatings} are there where no one is
seated next to their spouse?  \hint Use inclusion-exclusion.

\examspace[2in]
\begin{solution}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{Answer} &=& \{\mbox{Total seatings}\} \\
&-& \binom{4}{1} \times \{\mbox{Seatings with at least one couple seated together}\} \\
&+& \binom{4}{2} \times \{\mbox{Seatings with at least two couples seated together}\} \\
&-& \binom{4}{3} \times \{\mbox{Seatings with at least three couples seated together}\} \\
&+& \binom{4}{4} \times\{\mbox{Seatings with the four couples seated together}\} \\
&=& 7! - 4 \cdot (2 \cdot 6!) + 6 \cdot (4\cdot 5!) - 4 \cdot (8 \cdot 4!) + 1 \cdot (16 \cdot 3!)
\end{eqnarray*}
