\begin{problem}
  \bparts The queen and king of hearts decide to host a poker game and
  invite their best friends: the queens and kings of clubs, diamonds, and
  spades.  The queen has a round table that can seat exactly $8$ people
  for the guests (the $3$ other couples) and the host and hostess (her
  husband and herself).

  She decides that the poker game would be more interesting if no one sits
  next to their spouse.  Help her figure how many ways she can do this by
  answering the questions below.

If each of the chairs around the table is marked with a distinct symbol in
$\set{P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_8}$, how many ways can the queen seat the $8$
people in the $8$ chairs?

%\begin{definition}

Two {\bf seatings} are defined to be equivalent, if one can be obtain the
other though a rotation.  For example, the two seatings below are
considered equivalent:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
$P_1$ & $P_2$ &$P_3$ &$P_4$ & $P_5$ & $P_6$ & $P_7$ & $P_8$ \\ \hline \hline
$K\spa$ & $Q\spa$ & $K\hea$ & $Q\hea$ & $K\dia$ & $Q\dia$ & $K\clu$ & $Q\clu$ \\ \hline
$K\dia$ & $Q\dia$ & $K\clu$ & $Q\clu$ & $K\spa$ & $Q\spa $ & $K\hea$ & $Q\hea$ \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

%\begin{eqnarray*}
%K\spa, Q\spa, K\hea, Q\hea, K\dia, Q\dia, K\clu, Q\clu \\
%Q\hea, K\dia, Q\dia, K\clu, Q\clu, K\spa, Q\spa, K\hea 
%\end{eqnarray*}
%\end{definition}

How many distinct \textbf{seatings} are there?

$\frac{8!}{8} = 7!$

\ppart How many distinct {\bf seatings} are there if the queen and king of
hearts must be seated next to each other?

\examspace[2in]
\begin{solution}
$2! \cdot \frac{7!}{7} = 2 \cdot 6!$
\end{solution}

\ppart How many distinct \textbf{seatings} are there if the queen and king
of hearts must be seated next to each other, and the queen and king of
spades must be seated next to each other?

\examspace[2in]
\begin{solution}
$2! \cdot 2! \cdot \frac{6!}{6} = 4 \cdot 5!$
\end{solution}

How many distinct {\bf seatings} are there where no one is seated next to their spouse?
{\em Hint:~Use inclusion-exclusion.} 

\examspace[2in]
\begin{solution}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{Answer} &=& \{\mbox{Total seatings}\} \\
&-& {4 \choose 1} \times \{\mbox{Seatings with at least one couple seated together}\} \\
&+& {4 \choose 2} \times \{\mbox{Seatings with at least two couples seated together}\} \\
&-& {4 \choose 3} \times \{\mbox{Seatings with at least three couples seated together}\} \\
&+& {4 \choose 4} \times\{\mbox{Seatings with the four couples seated together}\} \\
&=& 7! - 4 \cdot (2 \cdot 6!) + 6 \cdot (4\cdot 5!) - 4 \cdot (8 \cdot 4!) + 1 \cdot (16 \cdot 3!)
\end{eqnarray*}
