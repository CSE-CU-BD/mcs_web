\newcommand{\binw}{\set{0,1}^\omega}

\begin{problem}
Let $\binw$ be the uncountable set of infinite binary sequences.

Let $F_n$ be the set of infinite binary sequences $s$ whose bits are
all 0 after the $n$th bit.  That is, if we let $s_i$ be the $i$th bit
of any sequence $s \in \binw$, then 
\[
s \in F_n \QIFF \forall i >n.\, s_i = 0.
\]
For example, the sequence $s$ that starts $00110100\cdots 000\cdots$
is in $F_5$ since $s_i = 0$ for all $i > 5$.  In fact, this sequence
is by definition also in $F_6,F_7,\dots$.

\bparts

\ppart How big is $F_n$?  That is, what is the value of $\card{F_n}$?

\begin{solution}
\[
2^{n+1}
\]

There are only $2^{n+1}$ possible initial sequences of $n+1$ bits for
sequences in $F_n$ and after that all of them are all 0's.
\end{solution}

\ppart Conclude that the set $F \subset \binw$ of sequences with
only finitely many 1's, is a countable set.  (You may assume without
proof any results from class about countabillity.)

\begin{solution}
Note that
\[
F = \lgunion_0^\infty F_n.
\]
Now $F_n$ is finite and therefore is countable, and a countable union
of countable sets is countable (see
Problem~\bref{MQ_countable_union}), so $F$ is countable.

\end{solution}

\ppart Conclude that the set of infinite binary sequences with
infinitely many 1's is uncountable.

\begin{solution}
The set of sequences with infinitely many 1's is $\binw - F$.

Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $\binw - F$ was
countable.  Since the union of two countable sets is countable, this
implies $(\binw - F) \union F = \binw$ is countable,
contradicting the fact that $\binw$ is uncountable.
\end{solution}
