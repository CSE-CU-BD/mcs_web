\ppart Suppose we flip a fair coin until two Tails in a row come up.  What
is the expected number, $N_\mathtt{TT}$, of flips we perform?  \hint Let
$D$ be the tree diagram for this process.  Explain why $D = H\cdot D +T
\cdot(H\cdot D + T)$.  Use the Law of Total Expectation~\bref{total_expect}

\begin{solution}
$N_\mathtt{TT}=6$.

From $D$ and Total Expectation:
\[
N_\mathtt{TT} = \frac{1}{2}\cdot [1+ N_\mathtt{TT}] + \frac{1}{2} \cdot
\paren{ 1+ \frac{1}{2}\cdot[1+ N_\mathtt{TT}] + \frac{1}{2}\cdot 1}
\]
\end{solution}


\ppart Suppose we flip a fair coin until a Tail immediately followed by a
Head come up.  What is the expected number, $N_\mathtt{TH}$, of flips we
perform?

\begin{solution}
$N_\mathtt{TH}=4$.

  This time the tree diagram $C = H\cdot C +T\cdot B$ where the subtree $B =
  H + T\cdot B$.

So
\[
N_\mathtt{TH}  = \frac{1}{2} \cdot [1+ N_\mathtt{TH}] + \frac{1}{2}\cdot [1+ N_B]
\]
where $N_B$ is the expected number of flips in the $B$ subtree.  But
\[
N_B = \frac{1}{2}\cdot 1 + \frac{1}{2}\cdot [1+N_B].
\]
That is, $N_B = 2$.  Hence,
\[
N_\mathtt{TH} = \frac{1}{2}\cdot [1+ 2] + \frac{1}{2} \cdot [1+ N_\mathtt{TH}]
\]
which implies $N_\mathtt{TH} = 4$. 
\end{solution}

\ppart Suppose we now play a game: flip a fair coin until either
\texttt{TT} or \texttt{TH} first occurs.  You win if \texttt{TT} comes up
first, lose if \texttt{TH} comes up first.  Since \texttt{TT} takes 50\%
longer on average to turn up, your opponent agrees that he has the
advantage.  So you tell him you're willing to play if you pay him \$5 when
he wins, but he merely pays you a 20\% premium, that is, \$6, when you win.

If you do this, you're sneakily taking advantage of your opponent's
untrained intuition, since you've gotten him to agree to unfair odds.
What is your expected profit per game?

\begin{solution}
It's easy to see that both \texttt{TT} and \texttt{TH} are
  equally likely to show up first.  (Every game play consists of a
  sequence of \texttt{H}'s followed by a \texttt{T}, after which the game
  ends with a \texttt{T} or an \texttt{H}, with equal probability.)  So
  your expected profit is
\[
\frac{1}{2}\cdot 6 + \frac{1}{2}\cdot (-5)\]
dollars, that is 50 cents per game.  So leap to play.
\end{solution}
