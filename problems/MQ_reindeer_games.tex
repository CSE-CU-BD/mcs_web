\begin{problem}
Each year, Santa's reindeer hold ``Reindeer Games'', from which
Rudolph is pointedly excluded.  The Games consist of a sequence of
matches, where one reindeer competes against another.  Draws are not
possible.

On Christmas Eve, Santa produces a rank list of all his reindeer.  If
reindeer $p$ lost a match to reindeer $q$, then $p$ appears below $q$ in
Santa's ranking, but if he has any choice because of unplayed matches,
Santa can give higher rank to the reindeer he likes better.  To prevent
confusion, two reindeer may not play a match if either outcome would lead
to a cycle of reindeer, where each lost to the next.

\iffalse
Here is an example of a cycle:
\mfigure{!}{1.75in}{figures/cycle}
\fi

Though it is only October, the 2004 Reindeer Games have already begun.  We
can describe the results so far with a binary relation, $L$, on the set of
reindeer, where $p L q$ means that reindeer $p$ lost a match to reindeer
$q$.  Let $L^+$ be the corresponding positive-length path
relation\footnote{Thus, reindeer $p$ is related to reindeer $q$ by $L^+$
if $p$ lost to $q$ or if $p$ lost to a reindeer who lost to $q$ or if $p$
lost to a reindeer who lost to a reindeer who lost to $q$, etc.}.  Note
that $L^+$ is a partial order, so we can regard a match loser as
``smaller'' than the winner.

On the following page you'll find a list of terms and a sequence of
statements.  Add the appropriate term to each statement.

\bparts

\ppart An unbeaten reindeer is

\brule{3in} of the partial order $L^+$. \begin{solution}
a maximal element
\end{solution}

\ppart A reindeer who has lost every match so far is

\brule{3in} of the partial order $L^+$. \begin{solution}
a minimal element
\end{solution}

\ppart Two reindeer can \emph{not} play a match if they are

\brule{3in} of $L^+$. \begin{solution}
comparable elements
\end{solution}

\ppart A reindeer assured of first place in Santa's ranking is

\brule{3in} of $L^+$. \begin{solution}
a maximum element
\end{solution}

\ppart A sequence of reindeer which \emph{must} appear in the same
order in Santa's rank list is

\brule{3in}. \begin{solution}
a chain
\end{solution}

\ppart A set of reindeer such that any two could still play a match
is

\brule{3in}. \begin{solution}
an antichain
\end{solution}

\ppart The fact that no reindeer loses a match to himself implies
that $L^+$ is

\brule{3in}.  \begin{solution}
a strict partial order
\end{solution}

\ppart Santa's final ranking of his reindeer on Christmas Eve must be

\brule{3in} of $L^+$.  \begin{solution}
a topological sort
\end{solution}

\ppart No more matches are possible if and only if $L^+$ is

\brule{3in}.  \begin{solution}
a total order
\end{solution}

\begin{staffnotes}
The following part was cut because it depends on
Theorem~\bref{th:connectivity} which has not been covered at this
point.

\ppart Suppose that Santa has 11 reindeer.  If no more matches can
be played, what is the smallest possible number of matches already
played?  \brule{0.3in}

\begin{solution}
10.

Call the reindeer $r_1, \dots, r_{11}$.  Then no more matches can be
played if there were 10 matches in which $r_1$ lost to $r_2$, $r_2$
lost to $r_3$, etc.

If fewer than ten matches have been played, then the corresponding
digraph would not be connected even ignoring edge directions (by
Theorem~\bref{th:connectivity}).  So there would be two nonempty sets
of reindeer, $S$ and $T$, with no reindeer in $S$ having played a
match against a reindeer in $T$, in which case at least one more match
could be held between a reindeer in $S$ and a reindeer in $T$.
