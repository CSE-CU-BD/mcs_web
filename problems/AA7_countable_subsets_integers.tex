\begin{problem}

   Prove that the set of all finite subsets of nonnegative integers is countable.
   \hint: Think about 
    \[
    \text{sum}(F) \eqdef \text{the sum of the elements in $F$}.
    \]

\begin{solution}   
   
   There are only a finite number of sets of nonnegative integers whose sum is $n$: all
   the elements in the set are $\leq n$, and there are at most about $n+1$
   of them, so $n^{n+1}$ bounds the number of these sets. (There are much
   smaller bounds, but any one will do.)  
   
   So just list all the
   elements in order of their sum, with elements with the same sum
   ordered arbitrarily.  This list defines a bijection with N.

\end{solution}
