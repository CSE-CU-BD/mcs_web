\begin{problem}
\bparts
\ppart Show that every minimum spanning tree of a graph can be the result of
Algorithm~\bref{alg:MST1}.

\ppart Conclude Corollary ~\bref{cor:uniqMST} that if all
edges in a weighted graph have distinct weights, then the graph has a
\emph{unique} MST.

\begin{solution}
  Algorithm~\bref{alg:MST1} is deterministic without ties, so the
  unique tree its produces must be all the trees there are.
\end{solution}

\begin{editingnotes} 
Another approach is by contradiction: assume $M \neq N$ are MST's.
Choose the smallest edge in one and not the other, say $e \in M-N$.
Then $N+e$ has a cycle with a larger edge $g$, so $N+e-g$ will be a
smaller weight MST than $N$ by the same reasoning as proof of
Lemma~\bref{lem:edgeextends}.
