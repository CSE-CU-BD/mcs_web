\begin{problem}
Determine a valid coloring of the graph shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:to_color} using as few colors as possible. (Simply
write your proposed color for each vertex next to that vertex.  You
may use $R$ for red, $G$ for green, etc.)

\begin{solution}
There are odd-length cycles in the graph, so at least three colors
will be needed.  So assume that three colors are sufficient.  (If we
encounter a contradiction under this assumption, we will need to use
more colors.)  Start with the length-3 cycle $abda$.  All of its
vertices must be colored differently, so assign red to $a$, blue to
$b$, and green to $d$.  The length-3 cycle $bdhb$ now forces $h$ to be
colored red.  $f$ must now be colored green and $g$ must be colored
blue.  The coloring is valid so far.  $c$ is adjacent to a blue vertex
and a green vertex, and no others, it must be colored red.  Finally,
$e$ is not adjacent to any other vertices, so it can be assigned any
of the three colors.  Choosing red for $e$, the result is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:colored}.  There is no pair of like-colored adjacent
vertices, so this coloring is valid.
