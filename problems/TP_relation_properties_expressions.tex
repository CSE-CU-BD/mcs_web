\begin{problem}
Let $R$ be a binary relation on a set $D$.  Each of the following
equalities and containments expresses the fact that $R$ has one of the
basic relational properties: reflexive, irreflexive, symmetric,
asymmetric, antisymmetric, transitive.  Identify which property is
expressed by each of these formulas.

\bparts

\ppart $R \intersect \ident{D} =  \emptyset$
\begin{solution}
irreflexive
\end{solution}

\ppart $R \subseteq \inv{R}$
\begin{solution}
symmetric
\end{solution}

\ppart $R = \inv{R}$
\begin{solution}
symmetric
\end{solution}

\ppart $\ident{D} \subseteq R$
\begin{solution}
reflexive
\end{solution}

\ppart $R \subseteq R \compose R$
\begin{solution}
transitive
\end{solution}

\ppart $R \intersect \inv{R} = \emptyset$
\begin{solution}
asymmetric
\end{solution}

\ppart $R \intersect \inv{R} \subseteq \ident{D}$
\begin{solution}
antisymmetric
\end{solution}
