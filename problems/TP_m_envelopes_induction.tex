\begin{problem}

You are given $m$ envelopes, numbered $0, 1, \ldots, m-1$.  Envelope 0
contains $2^0 =1$ dollar, Envelope 1 contains $2^1 =2 $ dollars,
\dots, and Envelope $m-1$ contains $2^{m-1}$ dollars.  Let
\[
P(m) \eqdef \forall n.\ 1 \leq n < 2^m \QIMPLIES \exists S \subseteq
\text{envelopes}. \text{the total contents of $S$ is exactly $n$
  dollars}.
\]
Prove by induction that $P(m)$ holds for all integers $m \geq 1$.

%\hint Use induction on the number of envelopes $m$.

\begin{solution}

\inductioncase{Base case} ($m = 1$): The only possible value of $n$ is
1, and The sole envelope contains the needed \$1.

\inductioncase{Inductive step} Assume that $P(m)$ is true for some $m
\geq 1$.  We need to show that, given $m+1$ envelopes, there is a
subset that sums to exactly $n$ dollars for $1 \leq n < 2^{m+1}$.

There are two cases to consider:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $n < 2^m .$  By the Induction Hypothesis, we can get exactly
  $n$ dollars using a subset of the first $m$ envelopes.

\item $2^m \leq n < 2^{m+1} .$ Then, $n = k + 2^m$, where $0 \leq k <
  2^m$.  Now by Induction Hypothesis, we can get exactly $k$
  dollars using a subset of the first $m$ envelopes (if $k=0$, don't
  use any of these envelopes).  Then this subset along with the
  $(m+1)^{\textrm{st}}$ envelope sums to $k + 2^m = n$.
 \end{enumerate}

In either case, we are able to construct an amount of $n$ dollars
using a subset of the envelopes.  Therefore, $P(m+1)$ is true.  By
induction, we conclude that $P(m)$ is true for all $m > 0$.

\end{solution}
