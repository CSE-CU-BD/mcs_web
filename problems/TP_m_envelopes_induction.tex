\begin{problem}

You are given $m$ envelopes, numbered $1, 2, \ldots, m$. For 
$1 \leq i \leq m$, the $i^{\textrm{th}}$ envelope contains $2^{i-1}$
dollars. Using \emph{induction}, prove the following 

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Property}: For any $m$,
given a (nonnegative) dollar amount $n < 2^m$, there exists a subset of envelopes that contain
{\em exactly} $n$ dollars. 
\end{quote}

% \hint Construct the set $C$ consisting of positive integers $m$ for which the
% stated property does {\em not} hold for some $n < 2^m$. Prove via the
% WOP that $C$ is empty.

\begin{solution}

Denote $P(m)$ be the proposition that any dollar amount $n < 2^m$ can
be constructed using a subset of envelopes containing the stated
number of dollars. We will prove that $P(m)$
is true for all integers $m > 0$ using induction.

\inductioncase{Base case} ($m = 1$): We are given one (1) envelope that
contains one (1) dollar. Clearly, any dollar amount $n$ smaller than 2
can be achieved by either choosing the envelope itself, or nothing at all.

\inductioncase{Inductive step}
Assume that $P(m)$ is true for some $m > 0$. We need to show that
$P(m+1)$ is also true, i.e., any dollar amount smaller than $2^{m+1}$ can be
constructed using a subset of the $m+1$ envelopes.

Consider $n < 2^{m+1}$. There are two mutually exclusive cases:
\begin{enumerate}

\item $n < 2^m .$ By the Induction Hypothesis, we can exactly
  construct $n$ using a subset of the first $m$ envelopes. 

\item $2^m \leq n < 2^{m+1} .$ Then, $n = n' + 2^m$, where $0 \leq n' <
  2^m$. Since $n'$ can exactly be constructed using a subset of the
  first $m$ envelopes (via the Induction Hypothesis), we can 
  combine that subset with the $(m+1)^{\textrm{th}}$ envelope to
  exactly construct $n$.
 
\end{enumerate}

In both cases, we are always able to construct $n$ using
a subset of the envelopes. Therefore $P(m+1)$ is true. By induction,
we concluse that $P(m)$ is true for all $m > 0$.

\end{solution}
