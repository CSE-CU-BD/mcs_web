\begin{problem}

You are given $m$ envelopes, numbered $0, 1, \ldots, m-1$.  Envelope 0
contains one (1) dollar, Envelope 1 contains two (2) dollars, \dots,
and Envelope $m-1$ contains $2^{m-1}$ dollars.  Prove by induction on $m$
that for all nonnegative integers $m$,
\[
P(m) \eqdef \text{There is a subset of envelopes whose contents add up
  to \emph{exactly} $n$ dollars, for any nonnegative integer } n <
2^m.
\]

%\hint Use induction on the number of envelopes $m$.

\begin{solution}

\inductioncase{Base case} ($m = 1$): We need to get exactly \$$n$ for
$n=0,1$.  The empty subset of envelopes sums up to \$0, and the sole
envelope contains the needed \$1.

\inductioncase{Inductive step} Assume that $P(m)$ is true for some $m
\geq 1$.  We need to show that, given $m+1$ envelopes, there is a
subset that sums to exactly \$$n$ for $0 \leq n < 2^{m+1}$.

There are two cases to consider:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $n < 2^m .$ By the Induction Hypothesis, we can get exactly
  \$$n$ using a subset of the first $m$ envelopes.

\item $2^m \leq n < 2^{m+1} .$ Then, $n = k + 2^m$, where $0 \leq k <
  2^m$.  Now by Induction Hypothesis, we can get exactly \$$k$ using a
  subset of the first $m$ envelopes.  Then this subset along with the
  $m+1$st envelope sum to $k + 2^m = n$.
 \end{enumerate}

In either case, we are able to construct an amount of $n$ dollars
using a subset of the envelopes.  Therefore, $P(m+1)$ is true.  By
induction, we conclude that $P(m)$ is true for all $m > 0$.

\end{solution}
