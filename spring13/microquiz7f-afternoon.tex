Consider the following set and relations:

\addtolength{\leftskip}{55mm} $S = \{2, 6, 7, 8, 11\}$

$R_1$: the "exactly four less than" relation

$R_2$: the "divides" relation

\begin{problem}
List all $(a, b)$ pairs, such that $a, b \in S$ and...

\bparts
\ppart $a$ $R_1$ $b$
\ppart $a$ $R_2$ $b$
\ppart $a$ $(R_1 \times R_2)$ $b$

\eparts
