TP_mean_time_variance_given

Problem 6 from Spring '98 final exam (suggested by Michaela)
  Prove that there are 16,800 permutations of the letters
  {a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h} such that neither the letters {a,b,c} nor the
  letters {d,e} occur in order. For example, fbgadceh is not allowed
  because d occurs before e, and fagbecdh is not allowed because a
  occurs before b and b occurs before c, but fbgaedch is OK.
