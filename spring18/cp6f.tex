This first problem is meant as an easy review of set/power-set
properties.  If part(a) takes more than 10 min, end there, and in any
case, not more than 15 min on this problem, at which point just show
the soln to part(a).

\begin{staffnotes}
This next problem is just a rephrasing solely in terms of sets of the
discussion of Nim games and the Fundamental Thm of Win-lose Games of
Section~\bref{FundThm_Games}.  It is not necessary to review this
material to do the problem, as long as you are \textbf{comfortable
  with this kind of structural induction with infinite constructors.}
However, a review of Section~\bref{FundThm_Games} and
Problem~\bref{TP_nimset} is useful to motivate this problem.
