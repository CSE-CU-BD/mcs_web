\section{Sets}

We've been assuming that the concepts of sets, sequences, and functions are
already familiar ones, and we've mentioned them repeatedly.  Now we'll do a
quick review of the definitions.

\begin{editingnotes}
Propositions of the sort we've considered so far are good for
reasoning about individual statements, but not so good for reasoning
about a collection of objects.  Let's first review a couple
mathematical tools for grouping objects and then extend our logical
language to cope with such collections.
\end{editingnotes}

Informally, a \term{set} is a bunch of objects, which are called the
\term{elements} of the set.  The elements of a set can be just about
anything: numbers, points in space, or even other sets.  The conventional
way to write down a set is to list the elements inside curly-braces.  For
example, here are some sets:

\[
\begin{array}{rcll}
%\naturals & = & \set{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots} & \text{the} \text{nonnegative integers} \\
A & = & \set{\text{Alex}, \text{Tippy}, \text{Shells}, \text{Shadow}} & \text{dead pets} \\
B & = & \set{\text{red}, \text{blue}, \text{yellow}} & \text{primary colors} \\
C & = & \set{ \set{a, b}, \set{a, c}, \set{b, c}} & \text{a set of sets}
\end{array}
\]
This works fine for small finite sets.  Other sets might be defined by
indicating how to generate a list of them:
\begin{align*}
D & =  \set{1,2,4,8,16,\dots} & \text{the powers of 2}
\end{align*}

The order of elements is not significant, so $\set{x, y}$ and $\set{y, x}$
are the same set written two different ways.  Also, any object is, or is
not, an element of a given set ---there is no notion of an element
appearing more than once in a set.\footnote{It's not hard to develop a
notion of \term{multisets} in which elements can occur more than once, but
multisets are not ordinary sets.}  So writing $\set{x,x}$ is just
indicating the same thing twice, namely, that $x$ is in the set.  In
particular, $\set{x,x} = \set{x}$.

The expression $e \in S$ asserts that $e$ is an element of set $S$.  For
example, $32 \in D$ and $\text{blue} \in B$, but $\text{Tailspin}
\not\in A$ ---yet.

Sets are simple, flexible, and everywhere.  You'll find
some set mentioned in nearly every section of this text.

\subsection{Some Popular Sets}

Mathematicians have devised special symbols to represent some common
sets.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\textbf{symbol} & \textbf{set} & \textbf{elements} \\
\term{$\emptyset$} & the empty set & \text{none}\\
\term{$\naturals$} & nonnegative integers & $\set{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots}$ \\
\term{$\integers$} & integers & $\set{\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots}$ \\
\term{$\rationals$} & rational numbers & $\frac{1}{2},\ -\frac{5}{3},\ 16,\ \text{etc.}$ \\
\term{$\reals$} & real numbers & $\pi,\ e,\ -9,\ \sqrt{2},\ \text{etc.}$ \\
\term{$\complexes$} & complex numbers & $i,\ \frac{19}{2},\ \sqrt{2} - 2i,\ \text{etc.}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
A superscript ``$^+$'' restricts a set to its positive elements; for
example, \term{$\reals^+$} denotes the set of positive real numbers.  Similarly,
\term{$\reals^-$} denotes the set of negative reals.

\subsection{Comparing and Combining Sets}

The expression $S \subseteq T$ indicates that set $S$ is a \term{subset}
of set $T$, which means that every element of $S$ is also an element of
$T$ (it could be that $S=T$).  For example, $\naturals \subseteq
\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q} \subseteq
\reals$ (every rational number is a real number), but $\complexes
\not\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ (not every complex number is an integer).

As a memory trick, notice that the \term{$\subseteq$} points to the
smaller set, just like a $\leq$ sign points to the smaller number.
Actually, this connection goes a little further: there is a symbol
\term{$\subset$} analogous to $<$.  Thus, $S \subset T$ means that $S$
is a subset of $T$, but the two are \emph{not} equal.  So $A \subseteq
A$, but $A \not\subset A$, for every set $A$.

There are several ways to combine sets.  Let's define a couple of sets for
use in examples:
\begin{align*}
X & \eqdef \set{1, 2, 3} \\
Y & \eqdef \set{2, 3, 4}
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}

\item The \term{union} of sets $X$ and $Y$ (denoted $X$ \term{$\union$} $Y$)
contains all elements appearing in $X$ or $Y$ or both.  Thus, $X \union
Y = \set{1, 2, 3, 4}$.

\item The \term{intersection} of $X$ and $Y$ (denoted $X$
  \term{$\intersect$} $Y$) consists of all elements that appear in
  \textit{both} $X$ and $Y$.  So $X \intersect Y = \set{2, 3}$.

\item The \term{set difference} of $X$ and $Y$ (denoted $X$ \index{$-$,
    set difference}$-$ $Y$) consists of all elements that are in $X$, but not in $Y$.
  Therefore, $X - Y = \set{1}$ and $Y - X = \set{4}$.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Complement of a Set}

Sometimes we are focused on a particular domain, $D$.  Then for any
subset, $A$, of $D$, we define \term{$\overline{A}$} to be the set of all
elements of $D$ \textit{not} in $A$.  That is, $\overline{A} \eqdef D-A$.
The set $\overline{A}$ is called the \term{complement} of $A$.

For example, when the domain we're working with is the real numbers,
the complement of the positive real numbers is the set of negative real
numbers together with zero.  That is,
\[
\overline{\reals^+} = \reals^- \union \set{0}.
\]

It can be helpful to rephrase properties of sets using complements.  For
example, two sets, $A$ and $B$, are said to be \term{disjoint} iff they
have no elements in common, that is, $A \intersect B = \emptyset$.  This
is the same as saying that $A$ is a subset of the complement of $B$, that
is, $A \subseteq \overline{B}$.

\subsection{Power Set}

The set of all the subsets of a set, $A$, is called the \term{power
  set}, \term{$\power(A)$}, of $A$.  So $B \in \power(A)$ iff $B
\subseteq A$.  For example, the elements of $\power( \set{1, 2})$ are
$\emptyset, \set{1}, \set{2}$ and $\set{1, 2}$.

More generally, if $A$ has $n$ elements, then there are $2^n$ sets in
$\power(A)$.  For this reason, some authors use the notation $2^A$ instead
of $\power(A)$.

\subsection{Set Builder Notation}

An important use of predicates is in \term*{set builder notation}.  We'll
often want to talk about sets that cannot be described very well by
listing the elements explicitly or by taking unions, intersections,
etc., of easily-described sets.  Set builder notation often comes to the
rescue.  The idea is to define a \textit{set} using a \textit{predicate};
in particular, the set consists of all values that make the predicate
true.  Here are some examples of set builder notation:

\begin{align*}
A & \eqdef \set{n \in \naturals \suchthat \text{$n$ is a prime and $n =
    4k+1$ for some integer $k$}} \\
B & \eqdef \set{x \in \reals \suchthat x^3 - 3 x + 1 > 0} \\
C & \eqdef \set{a + b i \in \complexes \suchthat a^2 + 2 b^2 \leq 1}
\end{align*}

The set $A$ consists of all nonnegative integers $n$ for which the
predicate
\begin{center}
``$n$ is a prime and $n = 4k+1$ for some integer $k$''
\end{center}
is true.  Thus, the smallest elements of $A$ are:
\[
5, 13, 17, 29, 37, 41, 53, 57, 61, 73, \ldots.
\]
Trying to indicate the set $A$ by listing these first few elements
wouldn't work very well; even after ten terms, the pattern is not
obvious!  Similarly, the set $B$ consists of all real numbers $x$ for
which the predicate
\[
x^3 - 3x + 1 > 0
\]
is true.  In this case, an explicit description of the set $B$ in
terms of intervals would require solving a cubic equation.  Finally,
set $C$ consists of all complex numbers $a + b i$ such that:
\[
a^2 + 2 b^2 \leq 1
\]
This is an oval-shaped region around the origin in the complex plane.

\subsection{Proving Set Equalities}

Two sets are defined to be equal if they contain the same elements.  That
is, $X = Y$ means that $z \in X$ if and only if $z \in Y$, for all
elements, $z$.  (This is actually the first of the ZFC axioms.)  So set
equalities can be formulated and proved as ``iff'' theorems.  For
example:

\begin{theorem}[\term{Distributive Law} for Sets]
Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be sets.  Then:
\begin{equation}\label{set-distrib}
A \intersect (B \union C) = (A \intersect B) \union (A \intersect C)
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The equality~\eqref{set-distrib} is equivalent to the assertion that
\begin{equation}\label{set-distrib-z}
  z \in A \intersect (B \union C) \qiff z \in (A \intersect B)
  \union (A \intersect C)
\end{equation}
for all $z$.  Now we'll prove~\eqref{set-distrib-z} by a chain of iff's.

First we need a rule for distributing a propositional $\QAND$ operation
over an $\QOR$ operation.  It's easy to verify by truth-table that
\begin{lemma}\label{prop-distrib}
The propositional formula
\[
P \QAND (Q \QOR R)
\]
and
\[
(P \QAND Q) \QOR (P \QAND R)
\]
are equivalent.
\end{lemma}

Now we have
\begin{align*}
\lefteqn{z \in A \intersect (B \union C)}\\
& \qiff (z \in A) \QAND (z \in B \union C) & \text{(def of $\intersect$)}\\
& \qiff (z \in A) \QAND (z \in B \QOR z \in C)
                & \text{(def of $\union$)}\\
& \qiff (z \in A \QAND z \in B) \QOR (z \in A \QAND z \in C)
                & \text{(Lemma~\ref{prop-distrib})}\\
& \qiff (z \in A \intersect B) \QOR (z \in A \intersect C)
                & \text{(def of $\intersect$)}\\
& \qiff z \in (A \intersect B) \union (A \intersect C)
                & \text{(def of $\union$)}
\end{align*}

\end{proof}

\section{Sequences}

Sets provide one way to group a collection of objects.  Another way is
in a \term{sequence}, which is a list of objects called \term{terms}
or \term{components}.  Short sequences are commonly described by
listing the elements between parentheses; for example, $(a, b, c)$ is
a sequence with three terms.

While both sets and sequences perform a gathering role, there are
several differences.
\begin{itemize}

\item The elements of a set are required to be distinct, but terms in a
sequence can be the same.  Thus, $(a, b, a)$ is a valid sequence of length
three, but $\set{a, b, a}$ is a set with two elements ---not three.

\item The terms in a sequence have a specified order, but the elements
of a set do not.  For example, $(a, b, c)$ and $(a, c, b)$ are
different sequences, but $\set{a, b, c}$ and $\set{a, c, b}$ are the
same set.

\item Texts differ on notation for the \term{empty sequence}; we use
  \term{$\lambda$} for the empty sequence.
\end{itemize}

The product operation is one link between sets and sequences.  A
\term{product of sets}, $S_1 \times S_2 \times \cdots \times S_n$, is a
new set consisting of all sequences where the first component is drawn
from $S_1$, the second from $S_2$, and so forth.  For example, $\naturals
\times \set{a,b}$ is the set of all pairs whose first element is a
nonnegative integer and whose second element is an $a$ or a $b$:
\[
\naturals \times \set{a,b}
    = \set{(0,a), (0,b), (1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (2, b), \dots}
\]
A product of $n$ copies of a set $S$ is denoted $S^n$.  For example,
$\set{0, 1}^3$ is the set of all $3$-bit sequences:
\[
\set{0, 1}^3 = \set{ (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1),
                     (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1) }
\]

\section{Functions}\label{funcsubsec}

A \term{function} assigns an element of one set, called the
\term{domain}, to elements of another set, called the \term{codomain}.
The notation
\[
f: A \to B
\]
indicates that $f$ is a function with domain, $A$, and codomain, $B$.  The
familiar notation ``$f(a) = b$'' indicates that $f$ assigns the element $b
\in B$ to $a$.  Here $b$ would be called the \term*{value} of $f$ at
\term*{argument} $a$.

Functions are often defined by formulas as in:
\[
f_1(x) \eqdef \frac{1}{x^2}
\]
where $x$ is a real-valued variable, or
\[
f_2(y,z) \eqdef y\mathtt{10}yz
\]
where $y$ and $z$ range over binary strings, or
\[
f_3(x, n) \eqdef \text{ the pair } (n, x)
\]
where $n$ ranges over the nonnegative integers.

A function with a finite domain could be specified by a table that shows
the value of the function at each element of the domain.  For example, a function
$f_4(P,Q)$ where $P$ and $Q$ are propositional variables is specified by:
\[\begin{array}{|cc|c|}
\hline
P & Q & f_4(P,Q)\\
\hline \true & \true & \true\\
\hline \true & \false & \false\\
\hline \false & \true & \true\\
\hline \false & \false & \true\\
\hline
\end{array}\]
Notice that $f_4$ could also have been described by a formula:
\[
f_4(P,Q)  \eqdef [P \QIMPLIES Q].
\]

A function might also be defined by a procedure for computing its value at
any element of its domain, or by some other kind of specification.  For
example, define $f_5(y)$ to be the length of a left to right search of the
bits in the binary string $y$ until a \texttt{1} appears, so
\begin{eqnarray*}
f_5(0010) & = &  3,\\
f_5(100)  & = & 1,\\
f_5(0000) & \text{is} & \text{undefined}.
\end{eqnarray*}

Notice that $f_5$ does not assign a value to any string of just \texttt{0}'s.
This illustrates an important fact about functions: they need not assign a
value to every element in the domain.  In fact this came up in our first
example $f_1(x)=1/x^2$, which does not assign a value to $0$.  So in
general, functions may be \term{partial functions}, meaning that there may be domain
elements for which the function is not defined.  If a function is defined
on every element of its domain, it is called a \term{total function}.

It's often useful to find the set of values a function takes when applied
to the elements in \emph{a set} of arguments.  So if $f:A \to B$, and $S$
is a subset of $A$, we define $f(S)$ to be the set of all the values that
$f$ takes when it is applied to elements of $S$.  That is,
\[
f(S) \eqdef \set{b \in B \suchthat f(s) = b \text{ for some } s
  \in S}.
\]
For example, if we let $[r,s]$ denote the interval from $r$ to $s$ on the
real line, then $f_1([1,2]) = [1/4,1]$.

For another example, let's take the ``search for a \texttt{1}''
function, $f_5$.  If we let $X$ be the set of binary words which
start with an even number of \texttt{0}'s followed by a
\texttt{1}, then $f_5(X)$ would be the odd nonnegative integers.

Applying $f$ to a set, $S$, of arguments is referred to as
\hyperdef{mapping}{pointwise}{``applying $f$ \idx{pointwise} to $S$''}, and the
set $f(S)$ is referred to as the \term{image} of $S$ under
$f$.\footnote{There is a picky distinction between the function $f$ which
  applies to elements of $A$ and the function which applies $f$ pointwise
  to subsets of $A$, because the domain of $f$ is $A$, while the domain of
  pointwise-$f$ is $\power(A)$.  It is usually clear from context whether
  $f$ or pointwise-$f$ is meant, so there is no harm in overloading the
  symbol $f$ in this way.}  The set of values that arise from applying $f$
to all possible arguments is called the \term{range} of $f$.  That is,
\[
\range{f} \eqdef f(\domain{f}).
\]
Some authors refer to the codomain as the range of a function, but they
shouldn't.  The distinction between the range and codomain will be
important in Sections~\ref{surj_sec} and~\ref{mappingrule_sec} when we
relate sizes of sets to properties of functions between
them.

\subsection{Function Composition}\label{func_compose_subsec}

Doing things step by step is a universal idea.  Taking a walk is a literal
example, but so is cooking from a recipe, executing a computer program,
evaluating a formula, and recovering from substance abuse.

Abstractly, taking a step amounts to applying a function, and going step
by step corresponds to applying functions one after the other.  This is
captured by the operation of \term{composing} functions.  Composing the
functions $f$ and $g$ means that first $f$ applied is to some argument,
$x$, to produce $f(x)$, and then $g$ is applied to that result to produce
$g(f(x))$.

\begin{definition}\label{func_compose_def}
  For functions $f:A \to B$ and $g:B \to C$, the \term{composition},
  $g \compose f$, of $g$ with $f$ is defined to be the function
  $h:A \to C$ defined by the rule:
\begin{displaymath}
(g \compose f)(x) = h(x) \eqdef g(f(x)),
\end{displaymath}
for all $x \in A$.
\end{definition}

Function composition is familiar as a basic concept from elementary
calculus, and it plays an equally basic role in discrete mathematics.

\section{Binary Relations}

\term{Relations} are another fundamental mathematical data type.  Equality
and ``less-than'' are very familiar examples of mathematical relations.
These are called \term{binary relations} because they apply to a pair
$(a,b)$ of objects; the equality relation holds for the pair when $a=b$,
and less-than holds when $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $a < b$.

In this chapter we'll define some basic vocabulary and properties of binary
relations.

\hyperdef{func}{rel}{\section{Binary Relations and Functions}}
Binary relations are far more general than equality or less-than.
Here's the official definition:
\begin{definition}\label{reldef}
A \term{binary relation}, $R$, consists of a set, $A$, called
the \term{domain} of $R$, a set, $B$, called the \term{codomain} of $R$, and
a subset of $A \cross B$ called the \term{graph of $R$}.
\end{definition}

Notice that Definition~\ref{reldef} is exactly the same as the definition
in Section~\ref{funcsubsec} of a {\emph{function}}, except that it doesn't
require the functional condition that, for each domain element, $a$, there
is \emph{at most} one pair in the graph whose first coordinate is $a$.  So
a function is a special case of a binary relation.

A relation whose domain is $A$ and codomain is $B$ is said to be
``between $A$ and $B$'', or ``from $A$ to $B$.''  When the domain and
codomain are the same set, $A$, we simply say the \index{relation on a
set} relation is ``on $A$.''  It's common to use \idx{infix notation}
``$a \mrel{R} b$'' to mean that the pair $(a,b)$ is in the graph of
$R$.

For example, we can define an ``in-charge of'' relation, $T$, for MIT in
Spring '10 to have domain equal to the set, $F$, of names of the faculty
and codomain equal to all the set, $N$, of subject numbers in the current
catalogue.  The graph of $T$ contains precisely the pairs of the form
\[
(\ang{\text{instructor-name}}, \ang{\text{subject-num}})
\]
such that the faculty member named $\ang{\text{instructor-name}}$ is
in charge of the subject with number $\ang{\text{subject-num}}$ in Spring '10.
So $\graph{T}$ contains pairs like

\[\begin{array}{ll}
(\texttt{A. R. Meyer}, & \texttt{6.042}),\\
(\texttt{A. R. Meyer}, & \texttt{18.062}),\\
(\texttt{A. R. Meyer}, & \texttt{6.844}),\\
(\texttt{T. Leighton}, & \texttt{6.042}),\\
(\texttt{T. Leighton}, & \texttt{18.062}),\\
(\texttt{G, Freeman}, & \texttt{6.011}),\\
(\texttt{G, Freeman}, & \texttt{6.UAT}),\\
(\texttt{G. Freeman}, & \texttt{6.881})\\
(\texttt{G. Freeman}, & \texttt{6.882})\\
(\texttt{T. Eng},      & \texttt{6.UAT})\\
(\texttt{J. Guttag},  & \texttt{6.00})\\
\qquad \vdots
\end{array}\]

This is a surprisingly complicated relation: Meyer is in charge of
subjects with three numbers.  Leighton is also in charge of subjects with
two of these three numbers ---because the same subject, Mathematics for
Computer Science, has two numbers: 6.042 and 18.062, and Meyer and
Leighton are co-in-charge of the subject.  Freeman is in-charge of even
more subjects numbers (around 20), since as Department Education Officer,
he is in charge of whole blocks of special subject numbers.  Some
subjects, like 6.844 and 6.00 have only one person in-charge.  Some
faculty, like Guttag, are in charge of only one subject number, and no one
else is co-in-charge of his subject, 6.00.

Some subjects in the codomain, $N$, do not appear in the list ---that is,
they are not an element of any of the pairs in the graph of $T$; these are
the Fall term only subjects.  Similarly, there are faculty in the domain,
$F$, who do not appear in the list because all their in-charge subjects
are Fall term only.

\section{Images and Inverse Images}

%explain $R(D)$: take the endpoints of all the arrows that come from $D$.

If $R$ is a binary relation from $A$ to $B$, and $X$ is any set,
define the image, $R(X)$, of $X$ under $R$ to be the set elements of
$B$ that are related to something in $X$, namely,
\[
R(X) \eqdef \set{b \in B \suchthat xRb \text{ for some } x \in X}.
\]
In terms of arrows, $R(X)$ is simply the set of endpoints of arrows that
start at points in $X$.

So, $T(\set{\text{A. Meyer}})$ gives the subject numbers that Meyer is
in charge of in Spring '10.  In fact, $T(\set{\text{A. Meyer}})
= \set{6.042, 18.062, 6.844}$.  Since the domain, $F$, is the set of
all in-charge faculty, $T(F)$ is exactly the set of \emph{all} Spring
'10 subjects being taught.  Similarly, $\inv{T}(N)$ is the set of people
in-charge of a Spring '10 subject.

The faculty in charge of 6.UAT in Spring '10 can be found by taking the
pairs of the form
\[
(\ang{\text{instructor-name}}, 6.UAT)
\]
in the graph of the teaching relation, $T$, and then just listing the left
hand sides of these pairs; these turn out to be just Eng and Freeman.

The introductory course 6 subjects have numbers that start with
\emph{6.0}\,.  So we can likewise find out all the instructors in-charge
of introductory course 6 subjects this term, by taking all the pairs of
the form $(\ang{\text{instructor-name}}, 6.0\dots)$ and list the left hand
sides of these pairs.  For example, from the part of the graph of $T$
shown above, we can see that Meyer, Leighton, Freeman, and Guttag are
in-charge of introductory subjects this term.

These are examples of taking an \term{inverse image} of a set
under a relation.  If $R$ is a binary relation from $A$ to $B$, the
inverse, $\inv{R}$, of $R$, is the binary relation from $B$ to $A$
defined by reversing relation between elements.  Namely,
\[
b\mrel{\inv{R}}a \qiff a\mrel{R}b,
\]
for all $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.  In terms of arrows, $\inv{R}$ is the
relation obtained by reversing the direction of the arrows of $R$.

The \term{inverse image} of any set $X$ under $R$, is simply the image,
$\inv{R}(X)$, of $X$ under $\inv{R}$.

For example, let $D$ be the set of introductory course 6 subject
numbers.  So $\inv{T}(D)$, the inverse image of the set $D$ under the
relation, $T$, is the set of all faculty members in-charge of
introductory course 6 subjects in Spring '10.

It gets interesting when we write composite expressions mixing images,
inverse images and set operations.  For example, $T(\inv{T}(D))$ is
the set of Spring '10 subjects that have people in-charge who also are
in-charge of introductory subjects.  So $T(\inv{T}(D)) - D$ are the
advanced subjects with someone in-charge who is also in-charge of an
introductory subject.  Similarly, $\inv{T}(D) \intersect \inv{T}(N-D)$
is the set of faculty teaching both an introductory \emph{and} an
advanced subject in Spring '10.
