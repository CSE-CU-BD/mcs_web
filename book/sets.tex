\section{Sets}
\begin{editingnotes}
We've been assuming that the concepts of sets, sequences, and functions are
already familiar ones, and we've mentioned them repeatedly.  Now we'll do a
quick review of the definitions.
\end{editingnotes}

Propositions of the sort we've considered so far are good for
reasoning about individual statements, but not so good for reasoning
about a collection of objects.  Let's first review a couple
mathematical tools for grouping objects and then extend our logical
language to cope with such collections.

%%  \subsection{Does All This Really Work?}\label{setsreallywork}
%%  
%%  So this is where mainstream mathematics stands today: there is a handful
%%  of ZFC axioms from which virtually everything else in mathematics can be
%%  logically derived.  This sounds like a rosy situation, but there are
%%  several dark clouds, suggesting that the essence of truth in mathematics
%%  is not completely resolved.
%%  
%%  %
%%  \begin{itemize}
%%  
%%  \item The \idx{ZFC axioms} weren't etched in stone by God.  Instead, they were
%%    mostly made up by some guy named Zermelo.  Probably some days he
%%    forgot his house keys.
%%  
%%    So maybe \idx{Zermelo}, just like \idx{Frege}, didn't get his axioms
%%    right and will be shot down by some successor to \idx{Russell} who
%%    will use Zermelo's axioms to prove a proposition $P$ and its
%%    negation $\QNOT P$.  Then math would be broken.  This sounds crazy,
%%    but after all, it has happened before.
%%  
%%    In fact, while there is broad agreement that the ZFC axioms are capable
%%    of proving all of standard mathematics, the axioms have some further
%%    consequences that sound paradoxical.  For example, the \idx{Banach-Tarski}
%%    Theorem says that, as a consequence of the \idx{Axiom of Choice}, a solid ball
%%    can be divided into six pieces and then the pieces can be rigidly
%%    rearranged to give \emph{two} solid balls, each the same size as the
%%    original!
%%  
%%  \item Georg \term{Cantor} was a contemporary of \idx{Frege} and
%%    \idx{Russell} who first developed the theory of infinite sizes (because
%%    he thought he needed it in his study of Fourier series).  Cantor raised
%%    the question whether there is a set whose size is strictly between the
%%    ``smallest\footnote{See Problem~\ref{CP_smallest_infinite_set}}''
%%    infinite set, $\naturals$, and $\power(\naturals)$; he guessed not:
%%  
%%    \textbf{Cantor's \term{Continuum Hypothesis}}: There is no set, $A$,
%%    such that $\power(\naturals)$ is \idx{strictly bigger} than $A$ and $A$
%%    is strictly bigger than $\naturals$.
%%  
%%    The Continuum Hypothesis remains an open problem a century later.  Its
%%    difficulty arises from one of the deepest results in modern Set Theory
%%    ---discovered in part by \idx{G\"odel} in the 1930's and Paul
%%    \idx{Cohen} in the 1960's ---namely, the ZFC axioms are not sufficient
%%    to settle the Continuum Hypothesis: there are two collections of sets,
%%    each obeying the laws of \idx{ZFC}, and in one collection the Continuum
%%    Hypothesis is true, and in the other it is false.  So settling the
%%    Continuum Hypothesis requires a new understanding of what Sets should be
%%    to arrive at persuasive new axioms that extend ZFC and are strong enough
%%    to determine the truth of the Continuum Hypothesis one way or the other.
%%  
%%  \item But even if we use more or different axioms about sets, there are
%%    some unavoidable problems.  In the 1930's, \idx{G\"odel} proved that,
%%    assuming that an axiom system like \idx{ZFC} is consistent ---meaning
%%    you can't prove both $P$ and $\QNOT(P)$ for any proposition, $P$ ---then
%%    the very proposition that the system is consistent (which is not too
%%    hard to express as a logical formula) cannot be proved in the system.
%%    In other words, no \idx{consistent} system is strong enough to verify
%%    itself.
%%    
%%  \end{itemize}



\subsection{Function Composition}\label{func_compose_subsec}

Doing things step by step is a universal idea.  Taking a walk is a literal
example, but so is cooking from a recipe, executing a computer program,
evaluating a formula, and recovering from substance abuse.

Abstractly, taking a step amounts to applying a function, and going step
by step corresponds to applying functions one after the other.  This is
captured by the operation of \term{composing} functions.  Composing the
functions $f$ and $g$ means that first $f$ applied is to some argument,
$x$, to produce $f(x)$, and then $g$ is applied to that result to produce
$g(f(x))$.

\begin{definition}\label{func_compose_def}
  For functions $f:A \to B$ and $g:B \to C$, the \term{composition},
  $g \compose f$, of $g$ with $f$ is defined to be the function
  $h:A \to C$ defined by the rule:
\begin{displaymath}
h(x) \eqdef (g \compose f)(x) \eqdef g(f(x)),
\end{displaymath}
for all $x \in A$.
\end{definition}

Function composition is familiar as a basic concept from elementary
calculus, and it plays an equally basic role in discrete mathematics.


\section{Relations}\label{rel_sec}

\term{Relations} are another fundamental mathematical data type.  Equality
and ``less-than'' are very familiar examples of mathematical relations.
These are called \term{binary relations} because they apply to a pair
$(a,b)$ of objects; the equality relation holds for the pair when $a=b$,
and less-than holds when $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $a < b$.

In this section we'll define some basic vocabulary and properties of binary
relations.

\subsection{Binary Relations and Functions}
Binary relations are far more general than equality or less-than.
Here's the official definition:
\begin{definition}\label{reldef}
A \term{binary relation}, $R$, consists of a set, $A$, called
the \term{domain} of $R$, a set, $B$, called the \term{codomain} of $R$, and
a subset of $A \cross B$ called the \term{graph of $R$}.
\end{definition}

Notice that Definition~\ref{reldef} is exactly the same as the definition
in Section~\ref{funcsubsec} of a {\emph{function}}, except that it doesn't
require the functional condition that, for each domain element, $a$, there
is \emph{at most} one pair in the graph whose first coordinate is $a$.  So
a function is a special case of a binary relation.

A relation whose domain is $A$ and codomain is $B$ is said to be
``between $A$ and $B$'', or ``from $A$ to $B$.''  When the domain and
codomain are the same set, $A$, we simply say the \index{relation on a
set} relation is ``on $A$.''  It's common to use \idx{infix notation}
``$a \mrel{R} b$'' to mean that the pair $(a,b)$ is in the graph of
$R$.

For example, we can define an ``in-charge of'' relation, $T$, for MIT in
Spring '10 to have domain equal to the set, $F$, of names of the faculty
and codomain equal to all the set, $N$, of subject numbers in the current
catalogue.  The graph of $T$ contains precisely the pairs of the form
\[
(\ang{\text{instructor-name}}, \ang{\text{subject-num}})
\]
such that the faculty member named $\ang{\text{instructor-name}}$ is
in charge of the subject with number $\ang{\text{subject-num}}$ in Spring '10.
So $\graph{T}$ contains pairs like
\[\begin{array}{ll}
(\texttt{A. R. Meyer}, & \texttt{6.042}),\\
(\texttt{A. R. Meyer}, & \texttt{18.062}),\\
(\texttt{A. R. Meyer}, & \texttt{6.844}),\\
(\texttt{T. Leighton}, & \texttt{6.042}),\\
(\texttt{T. Leighton}, & \texttt{18.062}),\\
(\texttt{G, Freeman}, & \texttt{6.011}),\\
(\texttt{G. Freeman}, & \texttt{6.881})\\
(\texttt{G. Freeman}, & \texttt{6.882})\\
(\texttt{G. Freeman}, & \texttt{6.UAT})\\
(\texttt{T. Eng},      & \texttt{6.UAT})\\
(\texttt{J. Guttag},  & \texttt{6.00})\\
\qquad \vdots
\end{array}\]

This is a surprisingly complicated relation: Meyer is in charge of
subjects with three numbers.  Leighton is also in charge of subjects with
two of these three numbers ---because the same subject, Mathematics for
Computer Science, has two numbers: 6.042 and 18.062, and Meyer and
Leighton are co-in-charge of the subject.  Freeman is in-charge of even
more subjects numbers (around 20), since as Department Education Officer,
he is in charge of whole blocks of special subject numbers.  Some
subjects, like 6.844 and 6.00 have only one person in-charge.  Some
faculty, like Guttag, are in charge of only one subject number, and no one
else is co-in-charge of his subject, 6.00.

Some subjects in the codomain, $N$, do not appear in the list ---that is,
they are not an element of any of the pairs in the graph of $T$; these are
the Fall term only subjects.  Similarly, there are faculty in the domain,
$F$, who do not appear in the list because all their in-charge subjects
are Fall term only.

\subsection{Relational Images}
The idea of the image of a set under a function extends directly to
relations.

\begin{definition}
The \term{image} of a set, $Y$, under a relation, $R$, written $R(Y)$, is the
set of elements of the codomain, $B$, of $R$ that are related to some element in
$Y$, namely,
\[
R(Y) \eqdef \set{b \in B \suchthat yRb \text{ for some } y \in Y}.
\]
\end{definition}

For example, to find the subject numbers that Meyer is in
charge of in Spring '09, we can look for all the pairs of the form
\[
(\text{A. Meyer}, \ang{\text{subject-number}})
\]
in the graph of the teaching relation, $T$, and then just list the
right hand sides of these pairs.  These righthand sides are exactly the image
$T(\text{A. Meyer})$, which happens to be $\set{6.042, 18.062, 6.844}$.
Similarly, to find the subject numbers that either Freeman or Eng are
in charge of, we can collect all the pairs in $T$ of the form
\[
(\text{G. Freeman}, \ang{\text{subject-number}})
\]
or
\[
(\text{T. Eng}, \ang{\text{subject-number}});
\]
and list their right hand sides.  These right hand sides are exactly the image
$T(\set{\text{G. Freeman}, \text{T. Eng}}$.  So the partial list
of pairs in $T$ given above implies that
\[
\set{\texttt{6.011, 6.881, 6.882, 6.UAT}} \subseteq T(\set{\text{G. Freeman}, \text{T. Eng}}.
\]
Finally, since the domain, $F$, is the set of all in-charge faculty,
$T(F)$ is exactly the set of \emph{all} Spring '09 subjects being
taught.

\subsection{Inverse Relations and Images}

\begin{definition}
The \term{inverse}, $\inv{R}$ of a relation $R: A \to B$ is the
relation from $B$ to $A$ defined by the rule
\[
b \inv{R} a \QIFF a \mrel{R} B.
\]
The image of a set under the relation, $\inv{R}$, is called
the \term{inverse image} of the set.  That is, the inverse image of a
set, $X$, under the relation, $R$, is $\inv{R}(X)$.
\end{definition}

Continuing with the in-charge example above, we can find the faculty
in charge of 6.UAT in Spring '10 can be found by taking the pairs of
the form
\[
(\ang{\text{instructor-name}}, 6.UAT)
\]
in the graph of the teaching relation, $T$, and then just listing the
left hand sides of these pairs; these turn out to be just Eng and
Freeman.  These left hand sides are exactly the inverse image of
$\set{\text{6.UAT}}$ under $T$.

Now let $D$ be the set of introductory course 6 subject numbers.
These are the subject numbers that start with \emph{6.0}\,.  Now we
can likewise find out all the instructors who were in-charge of
introductory course 6 subjects in Spring '09, by taking all the pairs
of the form $(\ang{\text{instructor-name}}, 6.0\dots)$ and list the
left hand sides of these pairs.  These left hand sides are exactly the
inverse image of of $D$ under $T$.  From the part of the
graph of $T$ shown above, we can see that
\[
\set{\text{Meyer, Leighton, Freeman, Guttag}} \subseteq \inv{T}(D).
\]
That is, Meyer, Leighton, Freeman, and Guttag were among the
instructors in charge of introductory subjects in Spring '10.
Finally, the inverse image under $T$ of the set, $N$, of all subject
numbers is the set of all instructors who were in charge of a Spring
'09 subject.

It gets interesting when we write composite expressions mixing images,
inverse images and set operations.  For example, $T(\inv{T}(D))$ is
the set of Spring '09 subjects that have an instructor in charge who
also is in in charge of an introductory subject.  So $T(\inv{T}(D)) -
D$ are the advanced subjects with someone in-charge who is also
in-charge of an introductory subject.  Similarly, $\inv{T}(D) \intersect
\inv{T}(N-D)$ is the set of faculty in charge of both an introductory \emph{and}
an advanced subject in Spring '09.

\subsection{Surjective and Injective Relations}\label{surj_sec}

There are a few properties of relations that will be useful when we take
up the topic of counting because they imply certain relations between the
\emph{sizes} of domains and codomains.  We say a binary relation $R : A
\to B$ is:

\begin{itemize}

\item \term{surjective} when every element of $B$ is mapped to \textit{at
least once}; more concisely, $R$ is surjective iff $R(A)=B$.

\item \term{total} when every element of $A$ is assigned to some element of
  $B$; more concisely, $R$ is total iff $A=\inv{R}(B)$.

\item \term{injective} if every element of $B$ is mapped to \textit{at
most once}, and

\item \term{bijective} if $R$ is total, surjective, and injective
  \emph{function}.\footnote{These words ``surjective,''
``injective,'' and ``bijective'' are not very memorable.
Some authors use the possibly more memorable phrases \term{onto} for surjective,
\emph{one-to-one} for injective, and \emph{exact correspondence} for bijective.}

\end{itemize}

Note that this definition of $R$ being total agrees with the
definition in Section~\ref{funcsubsec} when $R$ is a function.

If $R$ is a binary relation from $A$ to $B$, we define $R(A)$ to to be the
\emph{range} of $R$.  So a relation is surjective iff its range equals its
codomain.  Again, in the case that $R$ is a function, these definitions of
``range'' and ``total'' agree with the definitions in
Section~\ref{funcsubsec}.

\subsection{Relation Diagrams}
We can explain all these properties of a relation $R:A \to B$ in terms of
a diagram where all the elements of the domain, $A$, appear in one column
(a very long one if $A$ is infinite) and all the elements of the codomain,
$B$, appear in another column, and we draw an arrow from a point $a$ in
the first column to a point $b$ in the second column when $a$ is related
to $b$ by $R$.  For example, here are diagrams for two functions:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}

\unitlength = 2pt
\begin{picture}(50,60)(-10,-5)
\thinlines
\put(-5,50){\makebox(0,0){$A$}}
  \put(35,50){\makebox(0,0){$B$}}
\put(-5,40){\makebox(0,0){a}}
  \put(0,40){\vector(1,0){28}}
  \put(35,40){\makebox(0,0){1}}
\put(-5,30){\makebox(0,0){b}}
  \put(0,30){\vector(3,-1){28}}
  \put(35,30){\makebox(0,0){2}}
\put(-5,20){\makebox(0,0){c}}

  \put(35,20){\makebox(0,0){3}}
\put(-5,10){\makebox(0,0){d}}
  \put(0,10){\vector(3,2){28}}
  \put(35,10){\makebox(0,0){4}}
\put(-5,0){\makebox(0,0){e}}
  \put(0,0){\vector(3,2){28}}
\end{picture}

& \hspace{0.5in} &

\unitlength = 2pt
\begin{picture}(50,60)(-10,-5)
\thinlines
\put(-5,50){\makebox(0,0){$A$}}
  \put(35,50){\makebox(0,0){$B$}}
\put(-5,40){\makebox(0,0){a}}
  \put(0,40){\vector(1,0){28}}
  \put(35,40){\makebox(0,0){1}}
\put(-5,30){\makebox(0,0){b}}
  \put(0,30){\vector(3,-1){28}}
  \put(35,30){\makebox(0,0){2}}
\put(-5,20){\makebox(0,0){c}}
  \put(0,20){\vector(3,-2){28}}
  \put(35,20){\makebox(0,0){3}}
\put(-5,10){\makebox(0,0){d}}
  \put(0,10){\vector(3,2){28}}
  \put(35,10){\makebox(0,0){4}}
\put(35,0){\makebox(0,0){5}}
\end{picture}

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Here is what the definitions say about such pictures:
\begin{itemize}

\item ``$R$ is a function'' means that every point in the domain column,
  $A$, has \emph{at most one arrow out of it}.

\item ``$R$ is total'' means that \emph{every} point in the $A$ column has
  \emph{at least one arrow out of it}.  So if $R$ is a function, being
  total really means every point in the $A$ column has
  \emph{exactly one arrow out of it}.

\item ``$R$ is surjective'' means that \emph{every} point in the codomain
  column, $B$, has \emph{at least one arrow into it}.

\item ``$R$ is injective'' means that every point in the codomain column,
  $B$, has \emph{at most one arrow into it}.

\item ``$R$ is bijective'' means that \emph{every} point in the $A$ column
      has exactly one arrow out of it, and \emph{every} point in the $B$ column
      has exactly one arrow into it.

\end{itemize}

So in the diagrams above, the relation on the left is a total, surjective
function (every element in the $A$ column has exactly one arrow out, and
every element in the $B$ column has at least one arrow in), but not
injective (element 3 has two arrows going into it).  The relation on the
right is a total, injective function (every element in the $A$ column has
exactly one arrow out, and every element in the $B$ column has at most one
arrow in), but not surjective (element 4 has no arrow going into it).

%Define $\inv{R}$ and explain with reversed arrows.  Deduce that that
%$R$ is total iff $\inv{R} is surjective, $R$ is function iff
%$\inv{R}$ is injective.

Notice that the arrows in a diagram for $R$ precisely correspond to the
pairs in the graph of $R$.  But $\graph{R}$ does not determine by itself
whether $R$ is total or surjective; we also need to know what the domain
is to determine if $R$ is total, and we need to know the codomain to tell
if it's surjective.
\begin{example}
  The function defined by the formula $1/x^2$ is total if its domain is
  $\reals^+$ but partial if its domain is some set of real numbers
  including 0.  It is bijective if its domain and codomain are both
  $\reals^+$, but neither injective nor surjective if its domain and
  codomain are both $\reals$.
\end{example}


\section{Cardinality}\label{mappingrule_sec}

\subsection{Mappings and Cardinality}
The relational properties in Section~\ref{rel_sec} are useful in
figuring out the relative sizes of domains and codomains.

If $A$ is a finite set, we let $\card{A}$ be the number of elements in
$A$.  A finite set may have no elements (the empty set), or one
element, or two elements,\dots or any nonnegative integer number of
elements.

Now suppose $R:A \to B$ is a function.  Then every arrow in the diagram
for $R$ comes from exactly one element of $A$, so the number of arrows is
at most the number of elements in $A$.  That is, if $R$ is a function,
then
\[
\card{A} \geq \#\text{arrows}.
\]
Similarly, if $R$ is surjective, then every element of $B$ has an arrow
into it, so there must be at least as many arrows in the diagram as the
size of $B$.  That is,
\[
\#\text{arrows} \geq \card{B}.
\]
Combining these inequalities implies that if $R$ is a surjective
function, then $\card{A} \geq \card{B}$.  In short, if we write
$A \surj B$ to mean that there is a surjective function from $A$ to
$B$, then we've just proved a lemma: if $A \surj B$, then
$\card{A} \geq \card{B}$.  The following definition and lemma lists
this statement and three similar rules relating domain and codomain
size to relational properties.

\begin{definition}\label{bigger}
  Let $A,B$ be (not necessarily finite) sets.  Then
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $A$ \term{$\surj$} $B$ iff there is a surjective \emph{function} from $A$ to $B$.  

  \item $A$ \term{$\inj$} $B$ iff there is a total injective \emph{relation} from $A$ to $B$.

  \item $A$ \term{$\bij$} $B$ iff there is a bijection from $A$ to $B$.  

  \item $A$ \term{$\strict$} $B$ iff $A \surj B$, but not $B \surj A$.  

  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}\label{mapruldef}
[Mapping Rules] \mbox{}
Let $A$ and $B$ be finite sets.

\begin{enumerate}

\item\label{mapping-sur} If $A \surj B$, then $\card{A} \geq \card{B}$.

\item\label{mapping-inj} If $A \inj B$, then $\card{A} \leq \card{B}$.

\item\label{mapping-bij} If $R \bij B$, then $\card{A} = \card{B}$.

\item\label{mapping-strict} If $R \strict B$, then $\card{A} > \card{B}$.

\end{enumerate}

\end{lemma}

Mapping rule~\ref{mapping-inj}.\ can be explained by the same kind of
``arrow reasoning'' we used for rule~\ref{mapping-sur}.
Rules~\ref{mapping-bij}.\ and ~\ref{mapping-strict}.\ are immediate
consequences of these first two mapping rules.

\subsection{The sizes of infinite sets}

Mapping Rule~\ref{mapping-sur} has a converse:
if the size of a finite set, $A$, is greater than or equal to the size of
another finite set, $B$, then it's always possible to define a
surjective function from $A$ to $B$.  In fact, the surjection can be a
total function.  To see how this works, suppose for example that
\begin{align*}
A & =\set{a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5}\\
B & =\set{b_0,b_1,b_2,b_3}.
\end{align*}
Then define a total function $f:A\to B$ by the rules
\[
f(a_0) \eqdef b_0,\  f(a_1) \eqdef b_1,\  f(a_2) \eqdef b_2,\  f(a_3)=
f(a_4)=f(a_5) \eqdef b_3.
\]

\begin{editingnotes}

\[
f(a_i) \eqdef b_{\min(i,3)},
\]
for $i=0, \dots, 5$.  Since $5 \geq 3$, this $f$ is a surjection.
\end{editingnotes}

In fact, if $A$ and $B$ are finite sets of the same size, then we could also
define a bijection from $A$ to $B$ by this method.

In short, we have figured out if $A$ and $B$ are finite sets, then
$\card{A} \geq \card{B}$ \emph{if and only if} $A \surj B$, and similar
iff's hold for all the other Mapping Rules:
\begin{lemma}\label{finbig}
For \emph{finite} sets, $A,B$,
\begin{align*}
\card{A} \geq \card{B} & \qiff A \surj B,\\
\card{A} \leq \card{B} & \qiff A \inj B,\\
\card{A} = \card{B} & \qiff A \bij B,\\
\card{A} > \card{B} & \qiff A \strict B.
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}

This lemma suggests a way to generalize size comparisons to infinite sets,
namely, we can think of the relation $\surj$ as an ``\emph{at least as big
  as}'' relation between sets, even if they are infinite.  Similarly, the
relation $\bij$ can be regarded as a ``\term{same size}'' relation between
(possibly infinite) sets, and $\strict$ can be thought of as a
``\term{strictly bigger} than'' relation between sets.

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Warning}}: We haven't, and won't, define what the
``size'' of an infinite is.  The definition of infinite ``sizes'' is
cumbersome and technical, and we can get by just fine without it.  All we
need are the ``as big as'' and ``same size'' relations, $\surj$ and
$\bij$, between sets.

But there's something else to \textcolor{red}{watch out for}.  We've
referred to $\surj$ as an ``as big as'' relation and $\bij$ as a ``same
size'' relation on sets.  Of course most of the ``as big as'' and ``same
size'' properties of $\surj$ and $\bij$ on finite sets do carry over to
infinite sets, but \emph{some important ones don't} ---as we're about to
show.  So you have to be careful: don't assume that $\surj$ has any
particular ``as big as'' property on \emph{infinite} sets until it's been
proved.

Let's begin with some familiar properties of the ``as big as'' and ``same
size'' relations on finite sets that do carry over exactly to infinite
sets:
\begin{lemma}\label{translem}
For any sets, $A,B,C$,
\begin{enumerate}

\item \label{bigtrans}
$A \surj  B \text{ and } B \surj C, \qimplies  A \surj C$.

\item \label{sametrans} $A \bij B \text{ and } B \bij C, \qimplies A \bij C$.

\item\label{sameABA}
$A \bij B \qimplies B \bij A$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

Lemma~\ref{translem}.\ref{bigtrans} and~\ref{translem}.\ref{sametrans}
follow immediately from the fact that compositions of surjections are
surjections, and likewise for bijections, and
Lemma~\ref{translem}.\ref{sameABA} follows from the fact that the
inverse of a bijection is a bijection.  We'll leave a proof of these
facts to Problem~\ref{CP_surj_relation}.

Another familiar property of finite sets carries over to infinite sets,
but this time it's not so obvious:
\begin{theorem} [\idx{Schr\"oder-Bernstein}] For any sets $A,B$, if $A \surj B$
  and $B \surj A$, then $A \bij B$.
\end{theorem}

That is, the Schr\"oder-Bernstein Theorem says that if $A$ is at least as
big as $B$ and conversely, $B$ is at least as big as $A$, then $A$ is the
same size as $B$.  Phrased this way, you might be tempted to take this
theorem for granted, but that would be a mistake.  For infinite sets $A$
and $B$, the Schr\"oder-Bernstein Theorem is actually pretty technical.
Just because there is a surjective function $f:A\to B$ ---which need not
be a bijection ---and a surjective function $g:B \to A$ ---which also need
not be a bijection ---it's not at all clear that there must be a bijection
$e:A \to B$.  The idea is to construct $e$ from parts of both $f$ and $g$.
We'll leave the actual construction to
Problem~\ref{CP_Cantor_Schroeder_Bernstein_theorem}.

\subsection{Infinity is different}

A basic property of finite sets that does \emph{not} carry over to
infinite sets is that adding something new makes a set bigger.  That is,
if $A$ is a finite set and $b \notin A$, then $\card{A \union \set{b}} =
\card{A}+1$, and so $A$ and $A \union \set{b}$ are not the same size.  But
if $A$ is infinite, then these two sets \emph{are} the same size!

\begin{lemma}\label{AUb}
  Let $A$ be a set and $b \notin A$.  Then $A$ is infinite iff $A \bij A
  \union \set{b}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Since $A$ is \emph{not} the same size as $A \union \set{b}$ when $A$ is
  finite, we only have to show that $A \union \set{b}$ \emph{is} the same
  size as $A$ when $A$ is infinite.

That is, we have to find a bijection between $A \union \set{b}$ and $A$
when $A$ is infinite.  Here's how: since $A$ is infinite, it certainly has
at least one element; call it $a_0$.  But since $A$ is infinite, it has at
least two elements, and one of them must not be equal to $a_0$; call this
new element $a_1$.  But since $A$ is infinite, it has at least three
elements, one of which must not equal $a_0$ or $a_1$; call this new
element $a_2$.  Continuing in the way, we conclude that there is an
infinite sequence $a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n,\dots$ of different elements of
$A$.  Now it's easy to define a bijection $e: A \union \set{b} \to A$:
\begin{align*}
e(b) & \eqdef a_0,\\
e(a_n) & \eqdef a_{n+1}  &\text{ for } n \in \naturals,\\
e(a) & \eqdef a & \text{ for } a \in A - \set{b,a_0,a_1,\dots}.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

A set, $C$, is \term{countable} iff its elements can be listed in order,
that is, the distinct elements is $A$ are precisely
\[
c_0, c_1, \dots, c_n, \dots.
\]
This means that if we defined a function, $f$, on the nonnegative integers
by the rule that $f(i) \eqdef c_i$, then $f$ would be a bijection from
$\naturals$ to $C$.  More formally,

\begin{definition}
  A set, $C$, is \term{countably infinite} iff $\naturals \bij C$.  A set
  is \term{countable} iff it is finite or countably infinite.
\end{definition}

A small modification\footnote{See Problem~\ref{CP_smallest_infinite_set}}
of the proof of Lemma~\ref{AUb} shows that countably infinite sets are
the ``smallest'' infinite sets, namely, if $A$ is a countably infinite
set, then $A \surj \naturals$.

Since adding one new element to an infinite set doesn't change its
size, it's obvious that neither will adding any \emph{finite} number
of elements.  It's a common mistake to think that this proves that you
can throw in countably infinitely many new elements.  But just because
it's ok to do something any finite number of times doesn't make it OK
to do an infinite number of times.  For example, starting from 3, you
can add 1 any finite number of times and the result will be some
integer greater than or equal to 3.  But if you add add 1 a countably
infinite number of times, you don't get an integer at all.

It turns out you really can add a countably infinite number of new
elements to a countable set and still wind up with just a countably
infinite set, but another argument is needed to prove this:

\begin{lemma}\label{countable-union}
If $A$ and $B$ are countable sets, then so is $A \union B$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose the list of distinct elements of $A$ is $a_0,a_1,\dots$ and the
list of $B$ is $b_0,b_1, \dots$.  Then a list of all the elements in $A
\union B$ is just
\begin{equation}\label{a0b0list}
a_0,b_0,a_1,b_1, \dots a_n,b_n, \dots.
\end{equation}
Of course this list will contain duplicates if $A$ and $B$ have elements
in common, but then deleting all but the first occurrences of each element in
list~\eqref{a0b0list} leaves a list of all the distinct elements of $A$
and $B$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{\idx{Power sets} are \idx{strictly bigger}}

It turns out that the ideas behind \idx{Russell's Paradox}, which
caused so much trouble for the early efforts to formulate Set Theory,
also lead to a correct and astonishing fact discovered by Georg Cantor
in the late nineteenth century: infinite sets are \emph{not all the
same size}.

In particular,
\begin{theorem}\label{powbig}
For any set, $A$, the \idx{power set}, $\power(A)$, is \idx{strictly bigger} than $A$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  First of all, $\power(A)$ is as big as $A$: for example, the partial
  function $f:\power(A) \to A$, where $f(\set{a}) \eqdef a$ for $a \in A$
  and $f$ is only defined on one-element sets, is a surjection.

  To show that $\power(A)$ is strictly bigger than $A$, we have to show
  that if $g$ is a function from $A$ to $\power(A)$, then $g$ is not a
  surjection.  So, mimicking Russell's Paradox, define
  \[
  A_g \eqdef \set{a \in A \suchthat a \notin g(a)}.
  \]
  Now $A_g$ is a well-defined subset of $A$, which means it is a member of
  $\power(A)$.  But $A_g$ can't be in the range of $g$, because if it
  were, we would have
\[
A_g = g(a_0)
\]
for some $a_0 \in A$, so by definition of $A_g$,
\[
a \in g(a_0) \qiff a \in A_g \qiff a \notin g(a)
\]
for all $a \in A$.  Now letting $a = a_0$ yields the contradiction
\[
a_0 \in g(a_0) \qiff a_0 \notin g(a_0).
\]
So $g$ is not a surjection, because there is an element in the power set
of $A$, namely the set $A_g$, that is not in the range of $g$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Larger Infinities}

There are lots of different sizes of infinite sets.  For example, starting
with the infinite set, $\naturals$, of nonnegative integers, we can build
the infinite sequence of sets
\[
\naturals,\ \power(\naturals),\ \power(\power(\naturals)),\
\power(\power(\power(\naturals))),\ \dots.
\]
By Theorem~\ref{powbig}, each of these sets is strictly bigger than all
the preceding ones.  But that's not all: the union of all the sets in the
sequence is strictly bigger than each set in the sequence
(see Problem~\ref{CP_power_set_tower}).  In this way you can keep going,
building still bigger infinities.

So there is an endless variety of different size infinities.

\section{Infinities in Computer Science}

We've run into a lot of computer science students who wonder why they
should care about infinite sets.  They point out that any data set in
a computer memory is limited by the size of memory, and there is a
finite limit on the possible size of computer memory for the simple
reason that the universe is (or at least appears to be) finite.

\iffalse need to learn all this abstract theory of infinite sets, and this
is a good question.  \fi

The problem with this argument is that universe-size bounds on data
items are so big and uncertain (the universe seems to be getting
bigger all the time), that it's simply not helpful to make use of such
bounds.  For example, by this argument the physical sciences shouldn't
assume that measurements might yield arbitrary real numbers, because
there can only be a finite number of finite measurements in a universe
with a finite lifetime.  What do you think scientific theories would
look like without using the infinite set of real numbers?

Similarly, in computer science it simply isn't plausible that writing
a program to add nonnegative integers with up to as many digits as,
say, the stars in the sky (billions of galaxies each with billions of
stars), would be any different than writing a program that would add
any two integers no matter how many digits they had.

That's why basic programming data types like integers or strings, for
example, can be defined without imposing any bound on the sizes of
data items.  Each datum of type \idx{\texttt{string}} has only a
finite number of letters, but there are an infinite number of data items
of type \texttt{string}.  When we then consider string procedures of
type \idx{\texttt{string-->string}}, not only are there
an infinite number of such procedures, but each procedure generally
behaves differently on different inputs, so that a single
\texttt{string-->string} procedure may embody an infinite number of
behaviors.  In short, an educated computer scientist can't get around having to
cope with infinite sets.

On the other hand, the more exotic theory of different size infinities
and continuum hypotheses rarely comes up in mainstream mathematics,
and it hardly comes up at all in computer science, where the focus is
mainly on finite sets, and occasionallly on \idx{countable} sets.  In
practice, only logicians and set theorists have to worry about
collections that are too big to be sets.  In fact, at the end of the
19th century, the general mathematical community doubted the relevance
of what they called ``\idx{Cantor's paradise}'' of unfamiliar sets of
arbitrary infinite size.  So if the romance of really big infinities
doesn't appeal to you, be assured that not knowing about them won't
lower your professional abilities as a computer scientist.

Yet the idea behind Russell's paradox and Cantor's proof embodies the
simplest form of what is known as a ``\idx{diagonal argument}.''
Diagonal arguments are used to prove many fundamental results about
the limitations of computation, such as the undecidability of
the \idx{Halting Problem} for programs (see
Problem~\ref{CP_recognizable_sets}) and the inherent, unavoidable,
\idx{inefficiency} (\idx{exponential time} or worse) of procedures for
other computational problems.  So computer scientists do need to study
diagonal arguments in order to understand the logical limits of
computation.
