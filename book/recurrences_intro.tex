\TBA{DRAFT}
Recurrences are one aspect of a broad theme in computer science:
reducing a big problem to progressively smaller problems until easy
base cases are reached.  This same idea underlies both induction
proofs and recursive algorithms.  As we'll see, all three ideas snap
together nicely.  For example, one might describe the running time of
a recursive algorithm with a recurrence and use induction to
verify the solution.
