This text explains how to use mathematical models and methods to analyze
problems that arise in computer science.  Proofs play a central role in
this work because the authors share a belief with most mathematicians that
proofs are essential for genuine understanding.  Proofs also play a
growing role in computer science; they are used to certify that software
and hardware will \emph{always} behave correctly, something that no amount
of testing can do.

Simply put, a proof is a method of establishing truth.  Like beauty,
``truth'' sometimes depends on the eye of the beholder, and it should
not be surprising that what constitutes a proof differs among fields.
For example, in the judicial system, \emph{legal} truth is decided by
a jury based on the allowable evidence presented at trial.  In the
business world, \emph{authoritative} truth is specified by a trusted
person or organization, or maybe just your boss.  In fields such as
physics or biology, \emph{scientific} truth\footnote{Actually, only
  scientific \emph{falsehood} can be demonstrated by an
  experiment---when the experiment fails to behave as predicted.  But
  no amount of experiment can confirm that the \emph{next} experiment
  won't fail.  For this reason, scientists rarely speak of truth, but
  rather of \emph{theories} that accurately predict past, and
  anticipated future, experiments.\arm{Add comment re ``theory'' of
    evolution?}} is confirmed by experiment.  In statistics,
\emph{probable} truth is established by statistical analysis of sample
data.

\emph{Philosophical} proof involves careful exposition and
persuasion typically based on a series of small, plausible arguments.
The best example begins with ``Cogito ergo sum,'' a Latin sentence
that translates as ``I think, therefore I am.''  It comes from the
beginning of a 17th century essay by the mathematician/philosopher,
Ren\'e Descartes, and it is one of the most famous quotes in the
world: do a web search on the phrase and you will be flooded with
hits.

Deducing your existence from the fact that you're thinking about your
existence is a pretty cool and persuasive-sounding idea.  However,
with just a few more lines of argument in this vein, Descartes
\href{http://www.btinternet.com/~glynhughes/squashed/descartes.htm}{goes
  on} to conclude that there is an infinitely beneficent God.  Whether
or not you believe in an infinitely beneficent God, you'll probably
agree that any very short ``proof'' of God's infinite beneficence is
bound to be far-fetched.  So even in masterful hands, this approach is
not reliable.

Mathematics has its own specific notion of ``proof.''

\begin{definition*}
A \term{mathematical proof} of a \term{proposition} is a chain of \term{logical
deductions} leading to the proposition from a base set of \term{axioms}.
\end{definition*}

The three key ideas in this definition are highlighted:
\emph{proposition}, \emph{logical deduction}, and \emph{axiom}.
In the next Chapter, we'll discuss these
three ideas along with some basic ways of organizing proofs.
