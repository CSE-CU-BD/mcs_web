\section{Digraphs}\label{digraphs_sec}

\hyperdef{directed}{graph}{A \term{directed graph}} (\term{digraph}
for short) is formally the same as a binary relation, $R$, on a set,
$A$ ---that is, a relation whose domain and codomain are the same set,
$A$.  But we describe digraphs as though they were diagrams, with
elements of $A$ pictured as points on the plane and arrows drawn
between related points.  The elements of $A$ are referred to as the
\emph{vertices} of the digraph, and the pairs $(a,b) \in \graph{R}$
are \term{directed edges}.  Writing $\diredge{a}{b}$ is a more
suggestive alternative for the pair $(a,b)$.  Directed edges are also
called \term{arrows}.

For example, the divisibility relation on $\set{1,2,\dots,12}$ is
could be pictured by the digraph:

\subsection{Paths in Digraphs}

Picturing digraphs with points and arrows makes it natural to talk
about following a \term{path} of successive edges through the graph.
For example, in the digraph of Figure~\ref{fig:divisibility-digraph},
a path might start at vertex 1, successively follow the edges from
vertex 1 to vertex 2, from 2 to 4, from 4 to 12, and then from 12 to
12 twice (or as many times as you like).  We can represent the path
with the sequence of sucessive vertices it went through, in this case:
\[
1,2,4,12,12,12.
\]
So a path is just a sequence of vertices, with consecutive vertices on
the path connected by directed edges.  Here is a formal
definition:

\begin{definition}\label{paths}
A \emph{path in a digraph} is a sequence of vertices $a_0,\dots,a_k$
with $k \ge 0$ such that $\diredge{a_i}{a_{i+1}}$ is an edge of the
digraph for $i = 0,1,\dots, k-1$.  The path is said to \emph{start} at
$a_0$, to \emph{end} at $a_k$, and the \emph{length} of the path is
defined to be $k$.  The path is \emph{simple} iff all the $a_i$'s are
different, that is, if $i \neq j$, then $a_i \neq a_j$.
\end{definition}
Note that a single vertex counts as length zero path that begins and
ends at itself.

It's pretty natural to talk about the edges in a path, but
technically, paths only have points, not edges.  So to instead, we'll
say a path \term{traverses} an edge $\diredge{a}{b}$ when $a$ and $b$
are consecutive vertices in the path.

For any digraph, $R$, we can define some new relations on vertices
based on paths, namely, the \emph{path relation}, $R^*$, and the
\emph{positive-length path relation}, $R^+$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
a\, R^*\, b &\eqdef& \mbox{there is a path in $R$ from $a$ to $b$},\\
a\, R^+\, b &\eqdef& \mbox{there is a positive length path in $R$ from $a$ to $b$},
\end{eqnarray*}

By the definition of path, both $R^*$ and $R^+$ are transitive.  Since
edges count as length one paths, the edges of $R^+$ include all the
edges of $R$.  The edges of $R^*$ in turn include all the edges of
$R^+$ and, in addition include an edge (self-loop) from each vertex to
itself.  The self-loops get included in $R^*$ because of the a length
zero paths in $R$.  So $R^*$ is reflexive.  \footnote{In many texts,
  $R^+$ is called the \term{transitive closure} and $R^*$ is called
  the \term{reflexive transitive closure} of $R$.}

\section{Picturing Relational Properties}

Many of the relational properties we've discussed have natural
descriptions in terms of paths.  For example:
\begin{description}

\item[Reflexivity:] All vertices have self-loops (a \emph{self-loop} at a
vertex is an arrow going from the vertex back to itself).

\item[Irreflexivity:] No vertices have self-loops.

\item[Antisymmetry:] At most one (directed) edge between different
  vertices.

\item[Asymmetry:] No self-loops and at most one (directed) edge
  between different vertices.

\item[Transitivity:] Short-circuits---for any path through the graph,
there is an arrow from the first vertex to the last vertex on the path.

\item[Symmetry:] A binary relation $R$ is
  \hyperdef{graphs}{symmetric}{\term{symmetric}} iff $aRb$ implies
  $bRa$ for all $a,b$ in the domain of $R$.  That is, if there is an
  edge from $a$ to $b$, there is also one in the reverse direction.
  \iffalse The pair of directed edges between two vertices may be
  represented by a single \idx{undirected edge} may as well be
  represented without arrows, indicating that they can be followed in
  either direction.\fi

\end{description}

\section{Composition of Relations}\label{relation_compose_subsec}

There is a simple way to extend \idx{composition} of functions to
composition of relations, and this gives another way to talk about
paths in digraphs.

Let $R: B\to C$ and $S: A \to B$ be relations.  Then the
\idx{composition} of $R$ with $S$ is the binary relation $(R \compose
S): A\to C$ defined by the rule
\[
a \mrel{(R \compose S)} c \eqdef\ \exists b \in B.\, (b \mrel{R} c)
\QAND (a \mrel{S} b).
\]
This agrees with the Definition~\ref{func_compose_def} of composition
in the special case when $R$ and $S$ are functions.
\iffalse
\footnote{Some texts define $R \compose S$ the other way around, that
  is, with $S$ applied to the result of applying $R$ first.}
\fi

Now when $R$ is a digraph, it makes sense to compose $R$ with itself.
Then if we let $R^n$ denote the composition of $R$ with itself $n$
times, it's easy to check that $R^n$ is the length-$n$ path relation:
\[
a  \mrel{R^n} b \qiff \mbox{ there is a length $n$ path in $R$ from $a$ to $b$}.
\]
This even works for $n=0$, if we adopt the convention that $R^0$ is
the identity relation $\ident{A}$ on the set, $A$, of vertices.  That
is, $(a \mrel{\ident{A}} b)$ iff $a = b$.

\section{Directed Acyclic Graphs}\label{sec:dag}

\begin{definition}
A \term{cycle} in a digraph is defined by a path that begins and ends
at the same vertex.  This includes the cycle of length zero that
begins and ends at the vertex.  A \term{directed acyclic graph (DAG)}
is a directed graph with no \emph{positive} length cycles.

A \term{simple cycle} in a digraph is a cycle whose vertices are distinct
except for the beginning and end vertices.
\end{definition}

\iffalse
In contrast to undirected graphs, a single vertex \emph{is} considered to
be a simple cycle.
\fi

DAG's can be an economical way to represent partial orders.  For
example, the \emph{direct prerequisite} relation between MIT subjects
in Chapter~\ref{partial-order-chapter} was used to determine the
partial order of indirect prerequisites on subjects.  This indirect
prerequisite partial order is precisely the positive length path
relation of the direct prerequisites.

\begin{lemma}
If $D$ is a DAG, then $D^+$ is a strict partial order.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We know that $D^+$ is transitive.  Also, a positive length path from a
vertex to itself would be a cycle, so there are no such paths.  This means
$D^+$ is irreflexive, which implies it is a strict partial order (see
problem~\ref{CP_strict_PO_irreflexive}).
\end{proof}

It's easy to check that conversely, the graph of any strict partial
order is a DAG.

The divisibility partial order can also be more economically represented by
the path relation in a DAG.  \hyperdef{divisibility}{DAG}{A DAG whose
\emph{path} relation is divisibility} on $\set{1,2,\dots,12}$ is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:divisibility-DAG}; the arrowheads are omitted in the
Figure, and edges are understood to point upwards.

\caption{A DAG whose Path Relation is Divisibility on $\set{1,2,\dots,12}$.}
\label{fig:divisibility-DAG}
\end{figure}

If we're using a DAG to represent a partial order ---so all we care
about is the the path relation of the DAG ---we could replace the DAG
with any other DAG with the same path relation.  This raises the
question of finding a DAG with the same path relation but the
\emph{smallest} number of edges.  This DAG turns out to be unique and
easy to find (see problem~\ref{CP_covering_edges}).

\section{Traversing a Graph}
Can you walk every hallway in the Museum of Fine Arts {\em exactly
once}?  If we represent hallways and intersections with edges and
vertices, then this reduces to a question about graphs.  For example,
could you visit every hallway exactly once in a museum with this
floorplan?

\subsection{Euler Tours and Hamiltonian Cycles}

The entire field of graph theory began when Euler asked whether the seven
bridges of K\"onigsberg could all be traversed exactly once--- essentially
the same question we asked about the Museum of Fine Arts.  In his honor,
an \term{Euler walk} is a defined to be a path that traverses every edge
in a graph exactly once.  Similarly, an \term{Euler tour} is an Euler walk
that starts and finishes at the same vertex, that is a cycle that
traverses every edge exactly once.  Graphs with Euler tours and Euler
walks both have simple characterizations.

\begin{theorem}
A graph has an Euler tour iff it is connected and every vertex has even
degree.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose a graph has an Euler tour.  Every pair of vertices must appear in
the tour, so the graph is connected.  Moreover, a vertex that appears $k$
times in the tour must have degree $2k$, so every vertex of the graph has
even degree.

%Unconvincing

Conversely, suppose every vertex in a graph, $G$, has even degree.  Let $W
= (v_0,\dot,v_n)$ be the longest path in $G$ that traverses every edge
\textit{at most} once.  Now $W$ must traverse every edge incident to
$v_n$; otherwise, the path could be extended.  In particular, the $W$
traverses two of these edges each time it passes through $v_n$, and it
traverses $\edge{v_{n-1}}{v_n}$ at the end.  This accounts for an odd
number of edges, but the degree of $v_n$ is even by assumption.
Therefore, the $W$ must also begin at $v_n$; that is, $v_0 = v_n$.

Suppose that $W$ is not an Euler tour.  Because $G$ is a connected
graph, we can find an edge not in $W$ but incident to some vertex in
$W$.  Call this edge $\edge{u}{v_i}$.  But then we can construct a
longer walk:
%
\[
u, \edge{u}{v_i}, v_i, \edge{v_i}{v_{i+1}}, 
\dots, 
\edge{v_{n-1}}{v_n}, v_n, \edge{v_0}{v_1}, 
\dots, 
\edge{v_{i-1}}{v_i}, v_i
\]
%
This contradicts the definition of $W$, so $W$ must be an
Euler tour after all.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
A connected graph has an Euler walk if and only if either 0 or 2
vertices have odd degree.
\end{corollary}

\term{Hamiltonian cycles} are the unruly cousins of Euler tours.  A
\term{Hamiltonian cycle} is walk that starts and ends at the same
vertex and visits every \textit{vertex} in a graph exactly once.
There is no simple characterization of all graphs with a Hamiltonian
cycle.  (In fact, determining whether a given graph has a Hamiltonian
cycle is ``NP-complete''.)
