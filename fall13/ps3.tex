%Relations
%\pinput{CP_web_search} %was used last semester, but the only problem that gives a nice application analogy.

%Induction Proofs
%\pinput{PS_periphery_length_game} %was also used last semester but I really like the problem
\pinput{CP_divisible_by_powers_of_3}
\pinput{CP_fibonacci_by_induction}

%Bogus Induction
\pinput{TP_a_bogus_tiling_induction}
