%\ppart\label{remainder-arithmetic} Compute $\rem{2498754270^{184638463}9234673466^{844759364}){22}$.

%\hint $18^9 \equiv 8 \mod 22$

%\begin{solution}
%First, we replace the bases of the exponents with their remainders.

%$$\text{rem}((12^{184638463})(18^{844759364}), 22)$$

%Now, let's examine the remainders of the first few powers of $12$.

%\begin{align*}
%  \text{rem}(12, 22) &= 12 \\
%  \text{rem}(12^2, 22) &= 12 \\
%  \text{rem}(12^3, 22) &= 12 \\
%  \cdots
%\end{align*}

%The remainder is always $12$.  So we can now write

%$$\text{rem}((12)(18^{844759364}), 22).$$

%Now let's look at the remainders of powers of $18$.

%\begin{align*}
%  \text{rem}(18, 22) &= 18 \\
%  \text{rem}(18^2, 22) &= 16 \\
%  \text{rem}(18^3, 22) &= 2 \\
%  \text{rem}(18^4, 22) &= 14 \\
%  \text{rem}(18^5, 22) &= 10 \\
%  \text{rem}(18^6, 22) &= 4 \\
%  \text{rem}(18^7, 22) &= 6 \\
%  \text{rem}(18^8, 22) &= 20 \\
%  \text{rem}(18^9, 22) &= 8 \\
%  \text{rem}(18^{10}, 22) &= 12 \\
%  \text{rem}(18^{11}, 22) &= 18 \\
%  \cdots
%\end{align*}

%So it repeats after $11$ steps.  This means we can keep subtracting $11$ from the exponent until the computation becomes feasable.  In other words, we can replace the exponent with its %remainder mod $11$.

%\begin{align*}
%  \text{rem}((12)(18^9), 22) &= \text{rem}((12)(8), 22) \\
%  &= 8
%\end{align*}

%\end{solution}
