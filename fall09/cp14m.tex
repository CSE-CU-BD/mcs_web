\subsection*{Markov's Theorem}
\begin{theorem*}
If R is a nonnegative random variable, then for all $x > 0$
\[
\pr{R \geq x} \leq \frac{\expect{R}}{x}.
\]
\end{theorem*}


\subsection*{Variance}

The \emph{variance}, $\variance{R}$, of a random variable, $R$, is:
\[
\variance{R} \eqdef \expect{(R - \expect{R})^2}.
\]
It is easy to show that
\[
\variance{R}= \expect{R^2} - \expectsq{R}.
\]

\textbf{[Variance of an indicator variable]}, $I$, with $\pr{I=1} = p$:
\[
\variance{I} = pq
\]
where $q \eqdef 1-p$.

\textbf{[Variance and constants]}
For constants, $a,b$,
\[
\variance{aR+b} = a^2\variance{R}.
\]

\textbf{[Variance Additivity]}
If $R_1,R_2,\dots, R_n$ are \emph{pairwise} independent variables, then
\[
\variance{R_1 + R_2 + \cdots + R_n} =  \variance{R_1} + \variance{R_2} +
\cdots + \variance{R_n}
\]

%\textbf{[Variance of an $(n,p)$-binomially distributed variable]} $=npq$.

\subsection*{Chebyshev' s Bound}
\begin{theorem*}[Chebyshev]
Let $R$ be a random variable, and let $x$ be a positive real number.
Then
\[
\pr{\abs{R - \expect{R}} \geq x} \leq \frac{\variance{R}}{x^2}.
\]
\end{theorem*}
