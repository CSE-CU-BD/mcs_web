More precisely,
\begin{fact*}[Stirling's Approximation]
\[
\sqrt{2 \pi n} \paren{\frac{n}{e}}^n e^{1/(12n+1)} \leq n! \leq
\sqrt{2 \pi n} \paren{\frac{n}{e}}^n e^{1/12n}.
\]
\end{fact*}

Let $f,g$ be functions from $\reals$ to $\reals$.

\begin{itemize}

\item $f$ is \emph{asymptotically
equal} to $g$, in symbols,
\[
f(x) \sim g(x)
\]
iff
\[
\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x)/g(x) = 1.
\]

\item $f$ is \emph{asymptotically smaller} than $g$, in symbols,
\[
f(x) = o(g(x)),
\]
iff
\[
\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x)/g(x) = 0.
\]

\item for $g$ nonnegative,
\[
f = O(g)
\]
iff\footnote{
\[
\limsup_{x \rightarrow \infty} h(x) \eqdef \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}
\text{lub}_{y \geq x} h(y).
\]}
\[
\limsup_{x \rightarrow \infty} \abs{f(x)}/g(x) < \infty.
\]

An alternative, equivalent, definition is
\[
f = O(g)
\]
iff there exists a constant $c \geq 0$ and an $x_0$ such that for all $x \geq
x_0$, $\abs{f(x)} \leq c g(x)$.

\item Finally,
\[
f = \Theta(g) \quad\text{iff}\quad f=O(g) \land g=O(f).
\]

\end{itemize}
