\textbf{Reminder}:

\begin{itemize}

\item Problems should be
  \href{http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring14/submission.shtml}
       {submitted electronically}, and each problem should have an

{\emph{collaboration statement}}.

\item The class has a
  \href{http://piazza.com/mit/fall2013/6042j18062j/home}
       {Piazza forum} structured to get you help fast and efficiently
       from classmates and staff.  With Piazza you may post
       questions---both administrative and content related---to the
       entire class or to just the staff.  You are likely to get
       faster response through Piazza than from direct email to staff.
       Posting questions or comments to Piazza is optional.
