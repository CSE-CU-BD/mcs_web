%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Problems start here
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Number Theory: Congruences
\pinput{PS_check_factor_by_digits} 				%used in sp12, kinda cute
%\pinput{PS_pulverizer_machine}					%nice review of state machines and preserved invariant. perhaps good CP?
\pinput{PS_gcd_three_integers} 					%used in sp10, good practice with proofs
%\pinput{PS_fill_bucket_gcd}
\pinput{CP_pirate_treasure} 		% hooray pirates!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% possible problems that I did not like %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\pinput{PS_induction_mod_proof}				%boring
%\pinput{CP_nonparallel_lines} 					%not used in CP sp10, cute but hard to assign partial credit and seems a bit irrelevant
%\pinput{PS_non_unique_factoring} 				%used in sp12, dislike
%\pinput{PS_chinese_remainder_general}			%good hard problem, needs some work/structure? too long.
%\pinput{PS_calculating_inverses} 				%used in sp11, super easy calculation problem. save for MQ perhaps?

% Number Theory: Euler's Theorem
%\pinput{CP_Sk_equiv_-1_mod_p} 					%not used in CP sp10, short, so if the rest of the pset is too long, this could be good
\pinput{PS_order_divides_phi}
\pinput{PS_Euler_function_multiplicativity}  	%used Spring 09; soln hidden temporarily sp10

% Number Theory: RSA
\pinput{TP_RSA_reversed} 					%in sp12
\pinput{PS_RSA_key_implies_factoring}
\pinput{PS_Rabin_cryptosystem}
