The following problem is a small variation of
Problem~\bref{PS_bogus_prime_divides_integer_product} which appeared
on the \href{http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/fall13/cp4m.pdf}{
  Monday, Week 4 class problems}.  The version actually given in class
used the word ``product'' instead of ``\emph{finite} product,'' which
confused many students who misinterpreted ``product'' to mean
``product of two factors.''}
