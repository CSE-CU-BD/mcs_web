%%%%%% Pigeonhole Principle, Inclusion Exclusion, Combinatorial Proof

%a) setting up the pigeons and pigeonholes with the idea of having each even digit in between two odd digits %requires some thinking, which is good b) nice b/c it reviews concepts on degree zero vertex 

\pinput{PS_pigeon_hunting} 


%Inclusion-Exclusion nice b/c also reviews iff proof writing that students didnâ€™t do very well on the past midterm %
